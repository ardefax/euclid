       If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first do not measure the second, neither will any other measure any other.

    <p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, E, in continued proportion, and let A not measure B; I say that neither will any other measure any other. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now it is manifest that A, B, C, D, E do not measure one another in order; for A does not even measure B. </p>
  
    <p>I say, then, that neither will any other measure any other. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let A measure C. </p>
  
    <p>And, however many A, B, C are, let as many numbers F, G, H, the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, C, be taken. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.33">VII. 33</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now, since F, G, H are in the same ratio with A, B, C, and the multitude of the numbers A, B, C is equal to the multitude of the numbers F, G, H, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to C, so is F to H. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And since, as A is to B, so is F to G, while A does not measure B, therefore neither does F measure G; [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] therefore F is not an unit, for the unit measures any number. </p>
  
    <p>Now F, H are prime to one another. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.3">VIII. 3</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as F is to H, so is A to C; therefore neither does A measure C. </p>

    <p>Similarly we can prove that neither will any other measure any other. Q. E. D.</p>
