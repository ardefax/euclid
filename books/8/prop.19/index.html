  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B be two similar solid numbers, and let C, D, E be the sides of A, and F, G, H of B. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a href="/books/7/#def.21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as C is to D, so is F to G, and, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">G</hi> to <hi rend="ital">H</hi>.
      </p>
  
    <p>I say that between A, B there fall two mean proportional numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to F, D to G, and also E to H. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let C by multiplying D make K, and let F by multiplying G make L. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since C, D are in the same ratio with F, G, and K is the product of C, D, and L the product of F, G, K, L are similar plane numbers; [<a href="/books/7/#def.21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore between K, L there is one mean proportional number. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it be M
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore M is the product of D, F, as was proved in the theorem preceding this. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.18">VIII. 18</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now, since D by multiplying C has made K, and by multiplying F has made M, therefore, as C is to F, so is K to M. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as K is to M, so is M to L. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F. </p>
  
    <p>And since, as C is to D, so is F to G, alternately therefore, as C is to F, so is D to G. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.13">VII. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">H</hi>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F, in the ratio of D to G, and also in the ratio of E to H. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let E, H by multiplying M make N, O respectively. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since A is a solid number, and C, D, E are its sides, therefore E by multiplying the product of C, D has made A. </p>
  
    <p>But the product of C, D is K; therefore E by multiplying K has made A. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also <hi rend="ital">H</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">L</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since E by multiplying K has made A, and further also by multiplying M has made N, therefore, as K is to M, so is A to N. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as K is to M, so is C to F, D to G, and also E to H; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since E, H by multiplying M have made N, O respectively, therefore, as E is to H, so is N to O. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as E is to H, so is C to F and D to G; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N and N to O. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since H by multiplying M has made O, and further also by multiplying L has made B, therefore, as M is to L, so is O to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as M is to L, so is C to F, D to G, and E to H. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so not only is O to B, but also A to N and N to O. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, N, O, B are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides. </p>
  
    <p>I say that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, or D to G, and also E to H. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A, N, O, B are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to N. [<a href="/books/5/#def.10">V. Def. 10</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as A is to N, so it was proved that C is to F, D to G, and also E to H. </p>
