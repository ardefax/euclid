       Between two similar plane numbers there is one mean proportional number; and the plane number has to the plane number the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B be two similar plane numbers, and let the numbers C, D be the sides of A, and E, F of B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a href="/books/7/#def.21">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as C is to D, so is E to F. </p>
  
    <p>I say then that between A, B there is one mean proportional number, and A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to E, or D to F, that is, of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side. </p>
  
    <p>Now since, as C is to D, so is E to F, therefore, alternately, as C is to E, so is D to F. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.13">VII. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since A is plane, and C, D are its sides, therefore D by multiplying C has made A. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also E by multiplying F has made B. </p>
  
    <p>Now let D by multiplying E make G. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by multiplying E has made G, therefore, as C is to E, so is A to G. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as C is to E, so is D to F; therefore also, as D is to F, so is A to G. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since E by multiplying D has made G, and by multiplying F has made B, therefore, as D is to F, so is G to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">G</hi>; therefore also, as A is to G, so is G to B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, G, B are in continued proportion. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore between A, B there is one mean proportional number. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which C has to E or D to F. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A, G, B are in continued proportion, A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which it has to G. [<a href="/books/5/#def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as A is to G, so is C to E, and so is D to F. </p>
