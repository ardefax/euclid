    <p>
       Between two square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the square has to the square the ratio duplicate of that which the side has to the side.

    <p>Let A, B be square numbers, and let C be the side of A, and D of B; I say that between A, B there is one mean proportional number, and A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to D. </p>
  
    <p>For let C by multiplying D make E. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since A is a square and C is its side, therefore C by multiplying itself has made A. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also D by multiplying itself has made B. </p>
  
    <p>Since then C by multiplying the numbers C, D has made A, E respectively, therefore, as C is to D, so is A to E. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.18">VII. 18</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as A is to E, so is E to B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore between A, B there is one mean proportional number. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to D. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A, E, B are three numbers in proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which A has to E. [<a href="/books/5/#def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as A is to E, so is C to D. </p>
