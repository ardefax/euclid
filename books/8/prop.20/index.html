  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>For let one mean proportional number C fall between the two numbers A, B; I say that A, B are similar plane numbers. </p>
  
    <p>Let D, E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A, C, be taken; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.33">VII. 33</a>] therefore D measures A the same number of times that E measures C. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now, as many times as D measures A, so many units let there be in F; therefore F by multiplying D has made A, so that A is plane, and D, F are its sides. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since D, E are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with C, B, therefore D measures C the same number of times that E measures B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] 
      </p>
  
    <p>As many times, then, as E measures B, so many units let there be in G; therefore E measures B according to the units in G; therefore G by multiplying E has made B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore B is plane, and E, G are its sides. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B are plane numbers. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that they are also similar. </p>
  
    <p>For, &lt;*&gt; since F by multiplying D has made A, and by multiplying E has made C, therefore, as D is to E, so is A to C, that is, C to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, &lt;*&gt; since E by multiplying F, G has made C, B respectively, therefore, as F is to G, so is C to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as C is to B, so is D to E; therefore also, as D is to E, so is F to G. </p>
  
    <p>And alternately, as D is to F, so is E to G. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.13">VII. 13</a>] </p>

    <p>Therefore A, B are similar plane numbers; for their sides are proportional. Q. E. D.

        <p>25. <lemma from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">For, since F</lemma>......27. <lemma from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">C to B.</lemma> The text has clearly suffered corruption here. It is not necessary to infer from other facts that, as D is to E, so is A to C; for this is part of the hypotheses (ll. 6, 7). Again, there is no explanation of the statement (l. 25) that F by multiplying E has made C. It is the statement and explanation of this latter fact which are alone wanted; after which the proof proceeds as in l. 28. We might therefore substitute for ll. 25-28 the following.</p>
        <p>“For, since E measures C the same number of times that D measures A [l. 8], that is, according to the units in F [l. 10], therefore F by multiplying E has made C. </p>
        <p>And, since E by multiplying F, G,”
