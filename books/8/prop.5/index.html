    <p>Let A, B be plane numbers, and let the numbers C, D be the sides of A, and E, F of B; I say that A has to B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, the ratios being given which C has to E and D to F, let the least numbers G, H, K that are continuously in the ratios C : E, D : F be taken, so that, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">G</hi> to <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, and, as D is to F, so is H to K. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.4">VIII. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And let D by multiplying E make L. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by multiplying E has made L, therefore, as C is to E, so is A to L. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as C is to E, so is G to H; therefore also, as G is to H, so is A to L. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since E by multiplying D has made L, and further by multiplying F has made B, therefore, as D is to F, so is L to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as D is to F, so is H to K; therefore also, as H is to K, so is L to B. </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>.
