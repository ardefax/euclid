    <p>
       If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and each by multiplying itself make some number, the products will be proportional; and, if the original numbers by multiplying the products make certain numbers, the latter will also be proportional.

  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, in continued proportion, so that, as A is to B, so is B to C; let A, B, C by multiplying themselves make D, E, F, and by multiplying D, E, F let them make G, H, K; I say that D, E, F and G, H, K are in continued proportion. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let A by multiplying B make L, and let the numbers A, B by multiplying L make M. N respectively. </p>
  
    <p>And again let B by multiplying C make O, and let the numbers B, C by multiplying O make P, Q respectively. </p>
  
    <p>Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we can prove that D, L, E and G, M, N, H are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B, and further E, O, F and H, P, Q, K are continuously proportional in the ratio of B to C. </p>
  
    <p>Now, as A is to B, so is B to C; therefore D, L, E are also in the same ratio with E, O, F, and further G, M, N, H in the same ratio with H, P, Q, K. </p>
  
  </section>

  
  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>And the multitude of D, L, E is equal to the multitude of E, O, F, and that of G, M, N, H to that of H, P, Q, K; therefore, ex acquali, as <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, and, as G is to H, so is H to K.
