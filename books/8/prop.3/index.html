  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; 
       I say that the extremes of them A, D are prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>For let two numbers E, F, the least that are in the ratio of A, B, C, D, be taken, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.33">VII. 33</a>] then three others G, H, K with the same property; and others, more by one continually, [<a href="/books/8/#prop.2">VIII. 2</a>] until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of the numbers A, B, C, D. </p>
  
    <p>Let them be taken, and let them be L, M, N, O. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since E, F are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, they are prime to one another. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.22">VII. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the numbers E, F by multiplying themselves respectively have made the numbers G, K, and by multiplying the numbers G, K respectively have made the numbers L, O, [<a href="/books/8/#2.p.1">VIII. 2, Por.</a>] therefore both G, K and L, O are prime to one another. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.27">VII. 27</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since A, B, C, D are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, while L, M, N, O are the least that are in the same ratio with A, B, C, D, and the multitude of the numbers A, B, C, D is equal to the multitude of the numbers L, M, N, O, therefore the numbers A, B, C, D are equal to the numbers L, M, N, O respectively; therefore A is equal to L, and D to O. </p>
  
    <p>And L, O are prime to one another. </p>

    <p>Therefore A, D are also prime to one another. Q. E. D.</p>
