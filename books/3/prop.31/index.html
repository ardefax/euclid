  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>ABCD</var> be a circle, let <var>BC</var> be its diameter, and <var>E</var> its centre, and let <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var>, <var>AD</var>, <var>DC</var> be joined; I say that the angle <var>BAC</var> in the semicircle <var>BAC</var> is right, the angle <var>ABC</var> in the segment <var>ABC</var> greater than the semicircle is less  than a right angle, and the angle <var>ADC</var> in the segment <var>ADC</var> less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle. </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>AE</var> be joined, and let <var>BA</var> be carried through to <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>BE</var> is equal to <var>EA</var>, the angle <var>ABE</var> is also equal to the angle <var>BAE</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.5">I. 5</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>CE</var> is equal to <var>EA</var>, the angle <var>ACE</var> is also equal to the angle <var>CAE</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.5">I. 5</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the whole angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the two angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>ACB</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But the angle <var>FAC</var> exterior to the triangle <var>ABC</var> is also equal to the two angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>ACB</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle <var>BAC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>FAC</var>; therefore each is right; [<a href="/books/1/#def.10">I. Def. 10</a>] therefore the angle <var>BAC</var> in the semicircle <var>BAC</var> is right.
      </p>
  
    <p>Next, since in the triangle <var>ABC</var> the two angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>BAC</var> are less than two right angles, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.17">I. 17</a>] and the angle <var>BAC</var> is a right angle, the angle <var>ABC</var> is less than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment <var>ABC</var> greater than the semicircle. </p>
  
    <p>Next, since <var>ABCD</var> is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [<a href="/books/3/#prop.22">III. 22</a>] while the angle <var>ABC</var> is less than a right angle, therefore the angle <var>ADC</var> which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment <var>ADC</var> less than the semicircle. </p>
  
    <p>I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference <var>ABC</var> and the straight line <var>AC</var>, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference <var>ADC</var> and the straight line <var>AC</var>, is less than a right angle. </p>
  
    <p>This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var> is right, the angle contained by the circumference <var>ABC</var> and the straight line <var>AC</var> is greater than a right angle.
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines <var>AC</var>, <var>AF</var> is right, the angle contained by the straight line <var>CA</var> and the circumference <var>ADC</var> is less than a right angle.
