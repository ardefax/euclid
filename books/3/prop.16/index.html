    <p>Let <var>ABC</var> be a circle about <var>D</var> as centre and <var>AB</var> as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from <var>A</var> at right angles to <var>AB</var> from its extremity will fall outside the circle. </p>
  
    <p>For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as <var>CA</var>, and let <var>DC</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Since <var>DA</var> is equal to <var>DC</var>, 
       the angle <var>DAC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>ACD</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.5">I. 5</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>But the angle <var>DAC</var> is right; therefore the angle <var>ACD</var> is also right: thus, in the triangle <var>ACD</var>, the two angles <var>DAC</var>, <var>ACD</var> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.17">I. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the straight line drawn from the point <var>A</var> at right angles to <var>BA</var> will not fall within the circle. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference; therefore it will fall outside.
      </p>
  
    <p>Let it fall as <var>AE</var>; I say next that into the space between the straight line <var>AE</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var> another straight line cannot be interposed. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as <var>FA</var>, and let <var>DG</var> be drawn from the point <var>D</var> perpendicular to <var>FA</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since the angle <var>AGD</var> is right, and the angle <var>DAG</var> is less than a right angle, <var>AD</var> is greater than <var>DG</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.19">I. 19</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>But <var>DA</var> is equal to <var>DH</var>; therefore <var>DH</var> is greater than <var>DG</var>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference. </p>
  
    <p>I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line <var>BA</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var> is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference <var>CHA</var> and the straight line <var>AE</var> is less than any acute rectilineal angle. </p>
  
    <p>For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line <var>BA</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var>, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference <var>CHA</var> and the straight line <var>AE</var>, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line <var>AE</var> a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <var>BA</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var>, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <var>CHA</var> and the straight line <var>AE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But such a straight line cannot be interposed; </p>

    <p>therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line <var>BA</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var>, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference <var>CHA</var> and the straight line <var>AE</var>.â€” </p>
