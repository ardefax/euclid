  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>ABC</var> be a circle, and let a point <var>D</var> be taken outside <var>ABC</var>; let there be drawn through from it straight lines <var>DA</var>, <var>DE</var>, <var>DF</var>, <var>DC</var>, and let <var>DA</var> be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference <var>AEFC</var>, the straight line <var>DA</var> through the centre is greatest,  while <var>DE</var> is greater than <var>DF</var> and <var>DF</var> than <var>DC</var>.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference <var>HLKG</var>, the straight line <var>DG</var> between the point and the diameter <var>AG</var> is least; and the nearer to the least <var>DG</var> is always less than the more remote, namely <var>DK</var> than <var>DL</var>, and <var>DL</var> than <var>DH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For let the centre of the circle <var>ABC</var> be taken [<a href="/books/3/#prop.1">III. 1</a>], and let it be <var>M</var>; let <var>ME</var>, <var>MF</var>, <var>MC</var>, <var>MK</var>, <var>ML</var>, <var>MH</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>AM</var> is equal to <var>EM</var>, let <var>MD</var> be added to each; therefore <var>AD</var> is equal to <var>EM</var>, <var>MD</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>But <var>EM</var>, <var>MD</var> are greater than <var>ED</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.20">I. 20</a>] therefore <var>AD</var> is also greater than <var>ED</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>ME</var> is equal to <var>MF</var>, and <var>MD</var> is common, therefore <var>EM</var>, <var>MD</var> are equal to <var>FM</var>, <var>MD</var>; and the angle <var>EMD</var> is greater than the angle <var>FMD</var>;
       therefore the base <var>ED</var> is greater than the base <var>FD</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.24">I. 24</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that <var>FD</var> is greater than <var>CD</var>; therefore <var>DA</var> is greatest, while <var>DE</var> is greater than <var>DF</var>, and <var>DF</var> than <var>DC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Next, since <var>MK</var>, <var>KD</var> are greater than <var>MD</var>, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.20">I. 20</a>] and <var>MG</var> is equal to <var>MK</var>, therefore the remainder <var>KD</var> is greater than the remainder <var>GD</var>, so that <var>GD</var> is less than <var>KD</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>And, since on <var>MD</var>, one of the sides of the triangle <var>MLD</var>, two straight lines <var>MK</var>, <var>KD</var> were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore <var>MK</var>, <var>KD</var> are less than <var>ML</var>, <var>LD</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.21">I. 21</a>] and <var>MK</var> is equal to <var>ML</var>; therefore the remainder <var>DK</var> is less than the remainder <var>DL</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that <var>DL</var> is also less than <var>DH</var>; therefore <var>DG</var> is least, while <var>DK</var> is less than <var>DL</var>, and <var>DL</var> than <var>DH</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point <var>D</var> on the circle, one on each side of the least <var>DG</var>. </p>
  
    <p>On the straight line <var>MD</var>, and at the point <var>M</var> on it, let the angle <var>DMB</var> be constructed equal to the angle <var>KMD</var>, and let <var>DB</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>MK</var> is equal to <var>MB</var>, and <var>MD</var> is common, the two sides <var>KM</var>, <var>MD</var> are equal to the two sides <var>BM</var>, <var>MD</var> respectively; and the angle <var>KMD</var> is equal to the angle <var>BMD</var>; therefore the base <var>DK</var> is equal to the base <var>DB</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line <var>DK</var> will fall on the circle from the point <var>D</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be <var>DN</var>. Then, since <var>DK</var> is equal to <var>DN</var>,
      </p>
  
    <p>while <var>DK</var> is equal to <var>DB</var>, <var>DB</var> is also equal to <var>DN</var>, that is, the nearer to the least <var>DG</var> equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle <var>ABC</var> from the point <var>D</var>, one on each side of <var>DG</var> the least. </p>
