    <p>Let ABC be a circle; of the figures inscribed in the circle ABC let BC be the side of a decagon, CD that of a hexagon, and let them be in a straight line; I say that the whole straight line BD has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and CD is its greater segment. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let the centre of the circle, the point E, be taken, let EB, EC, ED be joined, and let BE be carried through to A. </p>
  
    <p>Since BC is the side of an equilateral decagon, therefore the circumference ACB is five times the circumference BC; therefore the circumference AC is quadruple of CB. </p>
  
    <p>But, as the circumference AC is to CB, so is the angle AEC to the angle CEB; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.33">VI. 33</a>] therefore the angle AEC is quadruple of the angle CEB. </p>
  
    <p>And, since the angle EBC is equal to the angle ECB, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.5">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle AEC is double of the angle ECB. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.32">I. 32</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the straight line EC is equal to CD, for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in the circle ABC, [<a href="/books/4/#15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] the angle CED is also equal to the angle CDE; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.5">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle ECB is double of the angle EDC. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.32">I. 32</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the angle AEC was proved double of the angle ECB; therefore the angle AEC is quadruple of the angle EDC. </p>
  
    <p>But the angle AEC was also proved quadruple of the angle BEC; therefore the angle EDC is equal to the angle BEC. </p>
  
    <p>But the angle EBD is common to the two triangles BEC and BED; therefore the remaining angle BED is also equal to the remaining angle ECB; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle EBD is equiangular with the triangle EBC. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, proportionally, as DB is to BE, so is EB to BC. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.4">VI. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But EB is equal to CD. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as BD is to DC, so is DC to CB. </p>
  
    <p>And BD is greater than DC; therefore DC is also greater than CB. </p>
