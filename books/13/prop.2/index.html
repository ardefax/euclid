    <p>For let the square on the straight line AB be five times the square on the segment AC of it, and let CD be double of AC; I say that, when CD is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is CB. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let the squares AF, CG be described on AB, CD respectively, let the figure in AF be drawn, and let BE be drawn through. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since the square on BA is five times the square on AC, AF is five times AH. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the gnomon MNO is quadruple of AH. </p>
  
    <p>And, since DC is double of CA, therefore the square on DC is quadruple of the square on CA, that is, CG is quadruple of AH. </p>
  
    <p>But the gnomon MNO was also proved quadruple of AH; therefore the gnomon MNO is equal to CG. </p>
  
    <p>And, since DC is double of CA, while DC is equal to CK, and AC to CH, therefore KB is also double of BH. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But LH, HB are also double of HB; therefore KB is equal to LH, HB. </p>
  
    <p>But the whole gnomon MNO was also proved equal to the whole CG; therefore the remainder HF is equal to BG. </p>
  
    <p>And BG is the rectangle CD, DB, for CD is equal to DG; and HF is the square on CB; therefore the rectangle CD, DB is equal to the square on CB. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as DC is to CB, so is CB to BD. </p>
  
    <p>But DC is greater than CB; therefore CB is also greater than BD. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, when the straight line CD is cut in extreme and mean ratio, CB is the greater segment. </p>
