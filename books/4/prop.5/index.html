    <p>Let <var>ABC</var> be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle <var>ABC</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let the straight lines <var>AB</var>, <var>AC</var> be bisected at the points <var>D</var>, <var>E</var> [<a href="/books/1/#prop.10">I. 10</a>], and from the points <var>D</var>, <var>E</var> let <var>DF</var>, <var>EF</var> be drawn at right angles to <var>AB</var>, <var>AC</var>; they will then meet within the triangle <var>ABC</var>, or on the straight line <var>BC</var>, or outside <var>BC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>First let them meet within at <var>F</var>, and let <var>FB</var>, <var>FC</var>, <var>FA</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>AD</var> is equal to <var>DB</var>, and <var>DF</var> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <var>AF</var> is equal to the base <var>FB</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that <var>CF</var> is also equal to <var>AF</var>; so that <var>FB</var> is also equal to <var>FC</var>; therefore the three straight lines <var>FA</var>, <var>FB</var>, <var>FC</var> are equal to one another.
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the circle described with centre <var>F</var> and distance one of the straight lines <var>FA</var>, <var>FB</var>, <var>FC</var> will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle <var>ABC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Let it be circumscribed, as <var>ABC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let <var>DF</var>, <var>EF</var> meet on the straight line <var>BC</var> at <var>F</var>, as is the case in the second figure; and let <var>AF</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point <var>F</var> is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle <var>ABC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Again, let <var>DF</var>, <var>EF</var> meet outside the triangle <var>ABC</var> at <var>F</var>, as is the case in the third figure, and let <var>AF</var>, <var>BF</var>, <var>CF</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then again, since <var>AD</var> is equal to <var>DB</var>, and <var>DF</var> is common and at right angles, therefore the base <var>AF</var> is equal to the base <var>BF</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that <var>CF</var> is also equal to <var>AF</var>; so that <var>BF</var> is also equal to <var>FC</var>; therefore the circle described with centre <var>F</var> and distance one of the straight lines <var>FA</var>, <var>FB</var>, <var>FC</var> will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle <var>ABC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F. </p>

    <p>And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle <var>BAC</var>, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; when the centre falls on the straight line <var>BC</var>, the angle <var>BAC</var>, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle <var>BAC</var>, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
