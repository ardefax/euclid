    <p>For let a straight line AB be set up at right angles to the three straight lines BC, BD, BE, at their point of meeting at B; I say that BC, BD, BE are in one plane. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let BD, BE be in the plane of reference and BC in one more elevated; let the plane through AB, BC be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a href="/books/11/#prop.3">XI. 3</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it make BF. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the three straight lines AB, BC, BF are in one plane, namely that drawn through AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since AB is at right angles to each of the straight lines BD, BE, therefore AB is also at right angles to the plane through BD, BE. [<a href="/books/11/#prop.4">XI. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the plane through BD, BE is the plane of reference; therefore AB is at right angles to the plane of reference. </p>
  
    <p>Thus AB will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [<a href="/books/11/#def.3">XI. Def. 3</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But BF which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle ABF is right. </p>
  
    <p>But, by hypothesis, the angle ABC is also right; therefore the angle ABF is equal to the angle ABC. </p>
  
    <p>And they are in one plane: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the straight line BC is not in a more elevated plane; therefore the three straight lines BC, BD, BE are in one plane. </p>
