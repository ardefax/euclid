    <p>For let the solid angle at A be contained by the three plane angles BAC, CAD, DAB; I say that any two of the angles BAC, CAD, DAB, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one. 
      </p>
  
    <p>If now the angles BAC, CAD, DAB are equal to one another, it is manifest that any two are greater than the remaining one. </p>
  
    <p>But, if not, let BAC be greater, and on the straight line AB, and at the point A on it, let the angle BAE be constructed, in the plane through BA, AC, equal to the angle DAB; let AE be made equal to AD, and let BEC, drawn across through the point E, cut the straight lines AB, AC at the points B, C; let DB, DC be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since DA is equal to AE, and AB is common, two sides are equal to two sides; and the angle DAB is equal to the angle BAE; therefore the base DB is equal to the base BE. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the two sides BD, DC are greater than BC, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.20">I. 20</a>] and of these DB was proved equal to BE, therefore the remainder DC is greater than the remainder EC. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since DA is equal to AE, and AC is common, and the base DC is greater than the base EC, therefore the angle DAC is greater than the angle EAC. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.25">I. 25</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the angle DAB was also proved equal to the angle BAE; therefore the angles DAB, DAC are greater than the angle BAC. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that the remaining angles also, taken together two and two, are greater than the remaining one. </p>
