    <p>If four straight lines be proportional, the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described will also be proportional; and, if the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described be proportional, the straight lines will themselves also be proportional.

    <p>Let AB, CD, EF, GH be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH; and let there be described on AB, CD, EF, GH the similar and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids KA, LC, ME, NG; I say that, as KA is to LC, so is ME to NG. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, since the parallelepipedal solid KA is similar to LC, therefore KA has to LC the ratio triplicate of that which AB has to CD. [<a href="/books/11/#prop.33">XI. 33</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason ME also has to NG the ratio triplicate of that which EF has to GH. [id.] </p>
  
    <p>And, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as AK is to LC, so is ME to NG. </p>
  
    <p>Next, as the solid AK is to the solid LC, so let the solid ME be to the solid NG; I say that, as the straight line AB is to CD, so is EF to GH. </p>
  
    <p>For since, again, KA has to LC the ratio triplicate of that which AB has to CD, [<a href="/books/11/#prop.33">XI. 33</a>] and ME also has to NG the ratio triplicate of that which EF has to GH, [id.] and, as KA is to LC, so is ME to NG, therefore also, as AB is to CD, so is EF to GH. </p>
