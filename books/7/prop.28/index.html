    <p>
       If two numbers be prime to one another, the sum will also be prime to each of them; and, if the sum of two numbers be prime to any one of them, the original numbers will also be prime to one another.

    <p>For let two numbers AB, BC prime to one another be added; I say that the sum AC is also prime to each of the numbers AB, BC. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, if CA, AB are not prime to one another, some number will measure CA, AB. </p>
  
    <p>Let a number measure them, and let it be D. </p>
  
    <p>Since then D measures CA, AB, therefore it will also measure the remainder BC. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures BA; therefore D measures AB, BC which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/books/7/#def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers CA, AB; therefore CA, AB are prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason AC, CB are also prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore CA is prime to each of the numbers AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>Again, let CA, AB be prime to one another; I say that AB, BC are also prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>For, if AB, BC are not prime to one another, some number will measure AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>Let a number measure them, and let it be D. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since D measures each of the numbers AB, BC, it will also measure the whole CA. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures AB; therefore D measures CA, AB which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [<a href="/books/7/#def.12">VII. Def. 12</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers AB, BC. </p>
