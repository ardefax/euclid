    <p>Let A be a composite number; I say that A is measured by some prime number. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
  
    <p>Let a number measure it, and let it be B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, if B is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
  
    <p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
  
    <p>Let a number measure it, and let it be C. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since C measures B, and B measures A, therefore C also measures A. </p>
  
    <p>And, if C is prime, what was enjoined will have been done. </p>
  
    <p>But if it is composite, some number will measure it. </p>
  
    <p>Thus, if the investigation be continued in this way, some prime number will be found which will measure the number before it, which will also measure A. </p>
  
    <p>For, if it is not found, an infinite series of numbers will measure the number A, each of which is less than the other: which is impossible in numbers. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore some prime number will be found which will measure the one before it, which will also measure A. </p>
