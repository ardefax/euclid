  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let AB, CD be the two given numbers not prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>Thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of AB, CD. </p>
  
    <p>If now CD measures AB—and it also measures itself—CD is a common measure of CD, AB. 
      </p>
  
    <p>And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for no greater number than CD will measure CD. </p>
  
    <p>But, if CD does not measure AB, then, the less of the numbers AB, CD being continually subtracted from the greater, some number will be left which will measure the one before it. </p>
  
    <p>For an unit will not be left; otherwise AB, CD will be prime to one another [<a href="/books/7/#prop.1">VII. 1</a>], which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore some number will be left which will measure the one before it. </p>
  
    <p>Now let CD, measuring BE, leave EA less than itself, let EA, measuring DF, leave FC less than itself, and let CF measure AE. </p>
  
    <p>Since then, CF measures AE, and AE measures DF, therefore CF will also measure DF. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures itself; therefore it will also measure the whole CD. </p>
  
    <p>But CD measures BE; therefore CF also measures BE. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures EA; therefore it will also measure the whole BA. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures CD; therefore CF measures AB, CD. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore CF is a common measure of AB, CD. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>
  
    <p>For, if CF is not the greatest common measure of AB, CD, some number which is greater than CF will measure the numbers AB, CD. </p>
  
    <p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be G. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since G measures CD, while CD measures BE, G also measures BE. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures the whole BA; therefore it will also measure the remainder AE. </p>
  
    <p>But AE measures DF; therefore G will also measure DF. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures the whole DC; therefore it will also measure the remainder CF, that is, the greater will measure the less: which is impossible. </p>
