  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B, C be the three given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let D, the least number measured by the two numbers A, B, be taken. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.34">VII. 34</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Then C either measures, or does not measure, D. </p>
  
    <p>First, let it measure it. </p>
  
    <p>But A, B also measure D; therefore A, B, C measure D. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the least that they measure. </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, A, B, C will measure some number which is less than D. </p>
  
    <p>Let them measure E. </p>
  
    <p>Since A, B, C measure E, therefore also A, B measure E. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the least number measured by A, B will also measure E. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But D is the least number measured by A, B; therefore D will measure E, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B, C will not measure any number which is less than D; therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is the least that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> measure.
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, let C not measure D, and let E, the least number measured by C, D, be taken. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.34">VII. 34</a>] 
      </p>
  
    <p>Since A, B measure D, and D measures E, therefore also A, B measure E. </p>
  
    <p>But C also measures E; therefore also A, B, C measure E. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the least that they measure. </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, A, B, C will measure some number which is less than E. </p>
  
    <p>Let them measure F. </p>
  
    <p>Since A, B, C measure F, therefore also A, B measure F; therefore the least number measured by A, B will also measure F. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.35">VII. 35</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But D is the least number measured by A, B; therefore D measures F. </p>
  
    <p>But C also measures F; therefore D, C measure F, so that the least number measured by D, C will also measure F. </p>
  
    <p>But E is the least number measured by C, D; therefore E measures F, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B, C will not measure any number which is less than E. </p>
