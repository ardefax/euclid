    <p>
       If four numbers be proportional, the number produced from the first and fourth will be equal to the number produced from the second and third; and, if the number produced from the first and fourth be equal to that produced from the second and third, the four numbers will be proportional.

    <p>Let A, B, C, D be four numbers in proportion, so that, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">C</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; and let A by multiplying D make E, and let B by multiplying C make F; I say that E is equal to F. </p>
  
    <p>For let A by multiplying C make G. </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, A by multiplying C has made G, and by multiplying D has made E, the number A by multiplying the two numbers C, D has made G, E. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as C is to D, so is G to E. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as C is to D, so is A to B; therefore also, as A is to B, so is G to E. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since A by multiplying C has made G, but, further, B has also by multiplying C made F, the two numbers A, B by multiplying a certain number C have made G, F. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as A is to B, so is G to F. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.18">VII. 18</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But further, as A is to B, so is G to E also; therefore also, as G is to E, so is G to F. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore G has to each of the numbers E, F the same ratio; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>. [cf. <a href="/books/5/#prop.9">V. 9</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, let E be equal to F; I say that, as A is to B, so is C to D. </p>
  
    <p>For, with the same construction, since E is equal to F, therefore, as G is to E, so is G to F. [cf. <a href="/books/5/#prop.7">V. 7</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as G is to E, so is C to D, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] and, as <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.18">VII. 18</a>]
