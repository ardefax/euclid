  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B, C be the three given numbers not prime to one another; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of A, B, C. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let the greatest common measure, D, of the two numbers A, B be taken; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.2">VII. 2</a>] then D either measures, or does not measure, C. </p>
  
    <p>First, let it measure it. </p>
  
    <p>But it measures A, B also; therefore D measures A, B, C; therefore D is a common measure of A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>I say that it is also the greatest. </p>
  
    <p>For, if D is not the greatest common measure of A, B, C, some number which is greater than D will measure the numbers A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be E. </p>
  
    <p>Since then E measures A, B, C, it will also measure A, B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of A, B. [<a href="/books/7/#2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the greatest common measure of A, B is D; therefore E measures D, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no number which is greater than D will measure the numbers A, B, C; therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is the greatest common measure of <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Next, let D not measure C; I say first that C, D are not prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A, B, C are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>
  
    <p>Now that which measures A, B, C will also measure A, B, and will measure D, the greatest common measure of A, B. [<a href="/books/7/#2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it measures C also; therefore some number will measure the numbers D, C; therefore D, C are not prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>Let then their greatest common measure E be taken. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.2">VII. 2</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Then, since E measures D, and D measures A, B, therefore E also measures A, B. </p>
  
    <p>But it measures C also; therefore E measures A, B, C; therefore E is a common measure of A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the greatest. </p>
  
    <p>For, if E is not the greatest common measure of A, B, C, some number which is greater than E will measure the numbers A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Let such a number measure them, and let it be F. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since F measures A, B, C, it also measures A, B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of A, B. [<a href="/books/7/#2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the greatest common measure of A, B is D; therefore F measures D. </p>
  
    <p>And it measures C also; therefore F measures D, C; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of D, C. [<a href="/books/7/#2.p.1">VII. 2, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the greatest common measure of D, C is E; therefore F measures E, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
