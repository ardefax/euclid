  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B be the two given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. </p>
  
    <p>Now A, B are either prime to one another or not. 
      </p>
  
    <p>First, let A, B be prime to one another, and let A by multiplying B make C; therefore also B by multiplying A has made C. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B measure C
      </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the least number they measure. </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, A, B will measure some number which is less than C. </p>
  
    <p>Let them measure D. </p>
  
    <p>Then, as many times as A measures D, so many units let there be in E, and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there be in F; therefore A by multiplying E has made D, and B by multiplying F has made D; [<a href="/books/7/#def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as A is to B, so is F
       E. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But A, B are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore B measures E, as consequent consequent. </p>
  
    <p>And, since A by multiplying B, E has made C, D, therefore, as B is to E, so is C to D. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But B measures E; therefore C also measures D, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B do not measure any number less than C; therefore C is the least that is measured by A, B. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A, B not be prime to one another, and let F, E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A, B, be taken; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.33">VII. 33</a>] therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And let A by multiplying E make C; therefore also B by multiplying F has made C; therefore A, B measure C. 
      </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also the least number that they measure. </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, A, B will measure some number which is less than C. </p>
  
    <p>Let them measure D. </p>
  
    <p>And, as many times as A measures D, so many units let there be in G, and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there be in H. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A by multiplying G has made D, and B by multiplying H has made D. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the product of A, G is equal to the product of B, H; therefore, as A is to B, so is H to G. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as A is to B, so is F to E. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as F is to E, so is H to G. </p>
  
    <p>But F, E are least, and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures G. </p>
  
    <p>And, since A by multiplying E, G has made C, D, therefore, as E is to G, so is C to D. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But E measures G; therefore C also measures D, the greater the less: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A, B will not measure any number which is less than C. </p>
