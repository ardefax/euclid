    <p>

  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>For let the number A be measured by any number B; I say that A has a part called by the same name as B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, as many times as B measures A, so many units let there be in C. </p>
  
    <p>Since B measures A according to the units in C, and the unit D also measures the number C according to the units in it, therefore the unit D measures the number C the same number of times as B measures A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, alternately, the unit D measures the number B the same number of times as C measures A; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.15">VII. 15</a>] therefore, whatever part the unit D is of the number B, the same part is C of A also. </p>
  
  </section>

  
  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>But the unit D is a part of the number B called by the same name as it; therefore C is also a part of A called by the same name as B, so that A has a part C which is called by the same name as B. Q. E. D.</p>
