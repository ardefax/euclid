    <p>
       If a number be the same parts of a number that a number subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also be the same parts of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

    <p>For let the number AB be the same parts of the number CD that AE subtracted is of CF subtracted; I say that the remainder EB is also the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let GH be made equal to AB. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever parts GH is of CD, the same parts also is AE of CF. </p>
  
    <p>Let GH be divided into the parts of CD, namely GK, KH, and AE into the parts of CF, namely AL, LE; thus the multitude of GK, KH will be equal to the multitude of AL, LE. </p>
  
    <p>Now since, whatever part GK is of CD, the same part also is AL of CF, while. CD is greater than CF, therefore GK is also greater than AL. </p>
  
    <p>Let GM be made equal to AL. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever part GK is of CD, the same part also is GM of CF; therefore also the remainder MK is the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.7">VII. 7</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since, whatever part KH is of CD, the same part also is EL of CF, while CD is greater than CF, therefore HK is also greater than EL. </p>
  
    <p>Let KN be made equal to EL. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever part KH is of CD, the same part also is KN of CF; therefore also the remainder NH is the same part of the remainder FD that the whole KH is of the whole CD. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.7">VII. 7</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the remainder MK was also proved to be the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD; therefore also the sum of MK, NH is the same parts of DF that the whole HG is of the whole CD. </p>

  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>But the sum of MK, NH is equal to EB, and HG is equal to BA; therefore the remainder EB is the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD. Q. E. D.</p>
