    <p>
       If a number be a part of a number, and another be the same part of another, the sum will also be the same part of the sum that the one is of the one.

    <p>For let the number A be a part of BC, and another, D, the same part of another EF that A is of BC; I say that the sum of A, D is also the same part of the sum of BC, EF that A is of BC. </p>
  
    <p>For since, whatever part A is of BC, D is also the same part of EF, therefore, as many numbers as there are in BC equal to A, so many numbers are there also in EF equal to D. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let BC be divided into the numbers equal to A, namely BG, GC, and EF into the numbers equal to D, namely EH, HF; then the multitude of BG, GC will be equal to the multitude of EH, HF. </p>
  
    <p>And, since BG is equal to A, and EH to D, therefore BG, EH are also equal to A, D. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason GC, HF are also equal to A, D. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as many numbers as there are in BC equal to A, so many are there also in BC, EF equal to A, D. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever multiple BC is of A, the same multiple also is the sum of BC, EF of the sum of A, D. </p>
