  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B, C be the given numbers, as many as we please; thus it is required to find the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>A, B, C are either prime to one another or not. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, if A, B, C are prime to one another, they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, if not, let D the greatest common measure of A, B, C be taken, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.3">VII. 3</a>] and, as many times as D measures the numbers A, B, C
       respectively, so many units let there be in the numbers E, F, G respectively. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the numbers E, F, G measure the numbers A, B, C respectively according to the units in D. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore E, F, G measure A, B, C the same number of times; therefore E, F, G are in the same ratio with A, B, C. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that they are the least that are in that ratio. </p>
  
    <p>For, if E, F, G are not the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, C, there will be numbers less than E, F, G which are in the same ratio with A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Let them be H, K, L; therefore H measures A the same number of times that the numbers K, L measure the numbers B, C respectively. </p>
  
    <p>Now, as many times as H measures A, so many units let there be in M; therefore the numbers K, L also measure the numbers B, C respectively according to the units in M. </p>
  
    <p>And, since H measures A according to the units in M, therefore M also measures A according to the units in H. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.16">VII. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason M also measures the numbers B, C according to the units in the numbers K, L respectively; </p>
  
    <p>Therefore M measures A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since H measures A according to the units in M, therefore H by multiplying M has made A. [<a href="/books/7/#def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also E by multiplying D has made A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the product of E, D is equal to the product of H, M. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as E is to H, so is M to D. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But E is greater than H; therefore M is also greater than D. </p>
  
    <p>And it measures A, B, C: which is impossible, for by hypothesis D is the greatest common measure of A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore there cannot be any numbers less than E, F, G which are in the same ratio with A, B, C. </p>
