    <p>Let A, B be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that A, B are prime to one another. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them. </p>
  
    <p>Let some number measure them, and let it be C. </p>
  
    <p>And, as many times as C measures A, so many units let there be in D, and, as many times as C measures B, so many units let there be in E
      </p>
  
    <p>Since C measures A according to the units in D, therefore C by multiplying D has made A. [<a href="/books/7/#def.15">VII. Def. 15</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also C by multiplying E has made B. </p>
  
    <p>Thus the number C by multiplying the two numbers D, E has made A, B; therefore, as D is to E, so is A to B; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.17">VII. 17</a>] therefore D, E are in the same ratio with A, B, being less than they: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no number will measure the numbers A, B. </p>
