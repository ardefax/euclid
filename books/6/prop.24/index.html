    <p>Let <var>ABCD</var> be a parallelogram, and <var>AC</var> its diameter, and let <var>EG</var>, <var>HK</var> be parallelograms about <var>AC</var>; I say that each of the parallelograms <var>EG</var>, <var>HK</var> is similar both to the whole <var>ABCD</var> and to the other. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, since <var>EF</var> has been drawn parallel to <var>BC</var>, one of the sides of the triangle <var>ABC</var>, proportionally, as <var>BE</var> is to <var>EA</var>, so is <var>CF</var> to <var>FA</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.2">VI. 2</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>FG</var> has been drawn parallel to <var>CD</var>, one of the sides of the triangle <var>ACD</var>, proportionally, as <var>CF</var> is to <var>FA</var>, so is <var>DG</var> to <var>GA</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.2">VI. 2</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>But it was proved that, as <var>CF</var> is to <var>FA</var>, so also is <var>BE</var> to <var>EA</var>; therefore also, as <var>BE</var> is to <var>EA</var>, so is <var>DG</var> to <var>GA</var>, and therefore, <var>componendo</var>, as <var>BA</var> is to <var>AE</var>, so is <var>DA</var> to <var>AG</var>, [<a href="/books/5/#prop.18">V. 18</a>] and, alternately, as <var>BA</var> is to <var>AD</var>, so is <var>EA</var> to <var>AG</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore in the parallelograms <var>ABCD</var>, <var>EG</var>, the sides about the common angle <var>BAD</var> are proportional. </p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>GF</var> is parallel to <var>DC</var>, the angle <var>AFG</var> is equal to the angle <var>DCA</var>; and the angle <var>DAC</var> is common to the two triangles <var>ADC</var>, <var>AGF</var>; therefore the triangle <var>ADC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>AGF</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason the triangle <var>ACB</var> is also equiangular with the triangle <var>AFE</var>, and the whole parallelogram <var>ABCD</var> is equiangular with the parallelogram <var>EG</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, proportionally, as <var>AD</var> is to <var>DC</var>, so is <var>AG</var> to <var>GF</var>, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CA</var>, so is <var>GF</var> to <var>FA</var>, as <var>AC</var> is to <var>CB</var>, so is <var>AF</var> to <var>FE</var>, and further, as <var>CB</var> is to <var>BA</var>, so is <var>FE</var> to <var>EA</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And, since it was proved that, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CA</var>, so is <var>GF</var> to <var>FA</var>, and, as <var>AC</var> is to <var>CB</var>, so is <var>AF</var> to <var>FE</var>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CB</var>, so is <var>GF</var> to <var>FE</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore in the parallelograms <var>ABCD</var>, <var>EG</var> the sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the parallelogram <var>ABCD</var> is similar to the parallelogram <var>EG</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason the parallelogram <var>ABCD</var> is also similar to the parallelogram <var>KH</var>; therefore each of the parallelograms <var>EG</var>, <var>HK</var> is similar to <var>ABCD</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.21">VI. 21</a>] therefore the parallelogram <var>EG</var> is also similar to the parallelogram <var>HK</var>. </p>
