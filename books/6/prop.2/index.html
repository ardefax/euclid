  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>For let <var>DE</var> be drawn parallel to <var>BC</var>, one of the sides of the triangle <var>ABC</var>; I say that, as <var>BD</var> is to <var>DA</var>, so is <var>CE</var> to <var>EA</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For let <var>BE</var>, <var>CD</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the triangle <var>BDE</var> is equal to  the triangle <var>CDE</var>; for they are on the same base <var>DE</var> and in the same parallels <var>DE</var>, <var>BC</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.38">I. 38</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the triangle <var>ADE</var> is another area. </p>
  
    <p>But equals have the same ratio to the same; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.7">V. 7</a>] therefore, as the triangle <var>BDE</var> is to the triangle <var>ADE</var>, so is the triangle <var>CDE</var> to the triangle <var>ADE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But, as the triangle <var>BDE</var> is to <var>ADE</var>, so is <var>BD</var> to <var>DA</var>; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from <var>E</var> to <var>AB</var>, they are to one another as their bases. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as the triangle <var>CDE</var> is to <var>ADE</var>, so is <var>CE</var> to <var>EA</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as <var>BD</var> is to <var>DA</var>, so is <var>CE</var> to <var>EA</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, let the sides <var>AB</var>, <var>AC</var> of the triangle <var>ABC</var> be cut proportionally, so that, as <var>BD</var> is to <var>DA</var>, so is <var>CE</var> to <var>EA</var>; and let <var>DE</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>I say that <var>DE</var> is parallel to <var>BC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, with the same construction, since, as <var>BD</var> is to <var>DA</var>, so is <var>CE</var> to <var>EA</var>, but, as <var>BD</var> is to <var>DA</var>, so is the triangle <var>BDE</var> to the triangle <var>ADE</var>, and, as <var>CE</var> is to <var>EA</var>, so is the triangle <var>CDE</var> to the triangle <var>ADE</var>, [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore also, as the triangle <var>BDE</var> is to the triangle <var>ADE</var>, so is the triangle <var>CDE</var> to the triangle <var>ADE</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore each of the triangles <var>BDE</var>, <var>CDE</var> has the same ratio to <var>ADE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the triangle <var>BDE</var> is equal to the triangle <var>CDE</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.9">V. 9</a>] and they are on the same base <var>DE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.39">I. 39</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore <var>DE</var> is parallel to <var>BC</var>. </p>
