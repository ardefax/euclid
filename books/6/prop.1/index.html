  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>ABC</var>, <var>ACD</var> be triangles and <var>EC</var>, <var>CF</var> parallelograms under the same height; I say that, as the base <var>BC</var> is to the base <var>CD</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABC</var> to the triangle <var>ACD</var>, and the parallelogram <var>EC</var> to the parallelogram <var>CF</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let <var>BD</var> be produced in both directions to the points <var>H</var>, <var>L</var> and let [any number of straight lines] <var>BG</var>, <var>GH</var> be made equal to the base <var>BC</var>, and any number of straight lines <var>DK</var>, <var>KL</var> equal to the base <var>CD</var>; let <var>AG</var>, <var>AH</var>, <var>AK</var>, <var>AL</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>CB</var>, <var>BG</var>, <var>GH</var> are equal to one another, the triangles <var>ABC</var>, <var>AGB</var>, <var>AHG</var> are also equal to one <lb n="15"/>another. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.38">I. 38</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <var>HC</var> is of the base <var>BC</var>, that multiple also is the triangle <var>AHC</var> of the triangle <var>ABC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason, whatever multiple the base <var>LC</var> is of the base <var>CD</var>, that multiple also is the triangle <var>ALC</var> of the triangle <var>ACD</var>; and, if the base <var>HC</var> is equal to the base <var>CL</var>, the triangle <var>AHC</var> is also equal to the triangle <var>ACL</var>, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.38">I. 38</a>] if the base <var>HC</var> is in excess of the base <var>CL</var>, the triangle <var>AHC</var>
       is also in excess of the triangle <var>ACL</var>, and, if less, less. </p>
  
    <p>Thus, there being four magnitudes, two bases <var>BC</var>, <var>CD</var> and two triangles <var>ABC</var>, <var>ACD</var>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <var>BC</var> and the triangle <var>ABC</var>, namely the base <var>HC</var> and the triangle <var>AHC</var>, and of the base <var>CD</var> and the triangle <var>ADC</var> other, chance, equimultiples, namely the base <var>LC</var> and the triangle <var>ALC</var>; and it has been proved that, if the base <var>HC</var> is in excess of the base <var>CL</var>, the triangle <var>AHC</var>
       is also in excess of the triangle <var>ALC</var>; if equal, equal; and, if less, less. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as the base <var>BC</var> is to the base <var>CD</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABC</var> to the triangle <var>ACD</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Next, since the parallelogram <var>EC</var> is double of the triangle <var>ABC</var>, [<a href="/books/1/#prop.41">I. 41</a>] and the parallelogram <var>FC</var> is double of the triangle <var>ACD</var>, while parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a href="/books/5/#prop.15">V. 15</a>] therefore, as the triangle <var>ABC</var> is to the triangle <var>ACD</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>EC</var> to the parallelogram <var>FC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, it was proved that, as the base <var>BC</var> is to <var>CD</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABC</var> to the triangle <var>ACD</var>, and, as the triangle <var>ABC</var> is to the triangle <var>ACD</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>EC</var> to the parallelogram <var>CF</var>, therefore also, as the base <var>BC</var> is to the base <var>CD</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>EC</var> to the parallelogram <var>FC</var>.
