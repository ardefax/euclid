    <p>Let <var>AC</var>, <var>CF</var> be equiangular parallelograms having the angle <var>BCD</var> equal to the angle <var>ECG</var>; I say that the parallelogram <var>AC</var> has to the parallelogram <var>CF</var> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let them be placed so that <var>BC</var> is in a straight line with <var>CG</var>; therefore <var>DC</var> is also in a straight line with <var>CE</var>.
       </p>
  
    <p>Let the parallelogram <var>DG</var> be completed; let a straight line <var>K</var> be set out, and let it be contrived that, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>CG</var>, so is <var>K</var> to <var>L</var>, and, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CE</var>, so is <var>L</var> to <var>M</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.12">VI. 12</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Then the ratios of <var>K</var> to <var>L</var> and of <var>L</var> to <var>M</var> are the same as the ratios of the sides, namely of <var>BC</var> to <var>CG</var> and of <var>DC</var> to <var>CE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But the ratio of <var>K</var> to <var>M</var> is compounded of the ratio of <var>K</var> to <var>L</var> and of that of <var>L</var> to <var>M</var>; so that <var>K</var> has also to <var>M</var> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. </p>
  
    <p>Now since, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>CG</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>AC</var> to the parallelogram <var>CH</var>, [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] while, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>CG</var>, so is <var>K</var> to <var>L</var>, therefore also, as <var>K</var> is to <var>L</var>, so is <var>AC</var> to <var>CH</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CE</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>CH</var> to <var>CF</var>, [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] while, as <var>DC</var> is to <var>CE</var>, so is <var>L</var> to <var>M</var>, therefore also, as <var>L</var> is to <var>M</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>CH</var> to the parallelogram <var>CF</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Since then it was proved that, as <var>K</var> is to <var>L</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>AC</var> to the parallelogram <var>CH</var>, and, as <var>L</var> is to <var>M</var>, so is the parallelogram <var>CH</var> to the parallelogram <var>CF</var>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>K</var> is to <var>M</var>, so is <var>AC</var> to the parallelogram
       <var>CF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>K</var> has to <var>M</var> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; therefore <var>AC</var> also has to <var>CF</var> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
