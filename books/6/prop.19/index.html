    <p>Let <var>ABC</var>, <var>DEF</var> be similar triangles having the angle at <var>B</var> equal to the angle at <var>E</var>, and such that, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>EF</var>, so that <var>BC</var> corresponds to <var>EF</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#def.11">V. Def. 11</a>] I say that the triangle <var>ABC</var> has to the triangle <var>DEF</var> a ratio duplicate of that which <var>BC</var> has to <var>EF</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let a third proportional <var>BG</var> be taken to <var>BC</var>, <var>EF</var>, so that, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>EF</var>, so is <var>EF</var> to <var>BG</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.11">VI. 11</a>] and let <var>AG</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Since then, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>EF</var>, therefore, alternately, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>DE</var>, so is <var>BC</var> to <var>EF</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>EF</var>, so is <var>EF</var> to <var>BG</var>; therefore also, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>DE</var>, so is <var>EF</var> to <var>BG</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore in the triangles <var>ABG</var>, <var>DEF</var> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. </p>
  
    <p>But those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.15">VI. 15</a>] therefore the triangle <var>ABG</var> is equal to the triangle <var>DEF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Now since, as <var>BC</var> is to <var>EF</var>, so is <var>EF</var> to <var>BG</var>, and, if three straight lines be proportional, the first has to the third a ratio duplicate of that which it has to the second, [<a href="/books/5/#def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore <var>BC</var> has to <var>BG</var> a ratio duplicate of that which <var>CB</var>
       has to <var>EF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>CB</var> is to <var>BG</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABC</var> to the triangle <var>ABG</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore the triangle <var>ABC</var> also has to the triangle <var>ABG</var> a ratio duplicate of that which <var>BC</var> has to <var>EF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But the triangle <var>ABG</var> is equal to the triangle <var>DEF</var>; therefore the triangle <var>ABC</var> also has to the triangle <var>DEF</var> a ratio duplicate of that which <var>BC</var> has to <var>EF</var>. </p>
