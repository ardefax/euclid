  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>AB</var> be the given straight line, <var>C</var> the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to <var>AB</var> is required to be equal, not being greater than the parallelogram described on the half of <var>AB</var> and similar to the defect, and <var>D</var> the parallelogram to which the defect is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the given straight line <var>AB</var> a parallelogram equal to the given rectilineal figure <var>C</var> and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to <var>D</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>AB</var> be bisected at the point <var>E</var>, and on <var>EB</var> let <var>EBFG</var> be described similar and similarly situated to <var>D</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.18">VI. 18</a>] let the parallelogram <var>AG</var> be completed. </p>
  
    <p>If then <var>AG</var> is equal to <var>C</var>, that which was enjoined will have been done; for there has been applied to the given straight line <var>AB</var> the parallelogram <var>AG</var> equal to the given rectilineal figure <var>C</var> and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure <var>GB</var> which is similar to <var>D</var>.
       
      </p>
  
    <p>But, if not, let <var>HE</var> be greater than <var>C</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Now <var>HE</var> is equal to <var>GB</var>; therefore <var>GB</var> is also greater than <var>C</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>KLMN</var> be constructed at once equal to the excess by which <var>GB</var> is greater than <var>C</var> and similar and similarly situated to <var>D</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.25">VI. 25</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But <var>D</var> is similar to <var>GB</var>; therefore <var>KM</var> is also similar to <var>GB</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.21">VI. 21</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Let, then, <var>KL</var> correspond to <var>GE</var>, and <var>LM</var> to <var>GF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since <var>GB</var> is equal to <var>C</var>, <var>KM</var>, therefore <var>GB</var> is greater than <var>KM</var>; therefore also <var>GE</var> is greater than <var>KL</var>, and <var>GF</var> than <var>LM</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>GO</var> be made equal to <var>KL</var>, and <var>GP</var> equal to <var>LM</var>; and let the parallelogram <var>OGPQ</var> be completed; therefore it is equal and similar to <var>KM</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore <var>GQ</var> is also similar to <var>GB</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.21">VI. 21</a>] therefore <var>GQ</var> is about the same diameter with <var>GB</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.26">VI. 26</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>GQB</var> be their diameter, and let the figure be described. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>BG</var> is equal to <var>C</var>, <var>KM</var>, and in them <var>GQ</var> is equal to <var>KM</var>, therefore the remainder, the gnomon <var>UWV</var>, is equal to the remainder <var>C</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>PR</var> is equal to <var>OS</var>, let <var>QB</var> be added to each; therefore the whole <var>PB</var> is equal to the whole <var>OB</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>OB</var> is equal to <var>TE</var>, since the side <var>AE</var> is also equal to the side <var>EB</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.36">I. 36</a>] therefore <var>TE</var> is also equal to <var>PB</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>OS</var> be added to each; therefore the whole <var>TS</var> is equal to the whole, the gnomon <var>VWU</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>But the gnomon <var>VWU</var> was proved equal to <var>C</var>; therefore <var>TS</var> is also equal to <var>C</var>.
