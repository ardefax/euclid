  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>ABCDE</var>, <var>FGHKL</var> be similar polygons, and let <var>AB</var> correspond to <var>FG</var>; I say that the polygons <var>ABCDE</var>, <var>FGHKL</var> are divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon <var>ABCDE</var> has to the polygon <var>FGHKL</var> a ratio duplicate of that which <var>AB</var> has to <var>FG</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Let <var>BE</var>, <var>EC</var>, <var>GL</var>, <var>LH</var> be joined. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since the polygon <var>ABCDE</var> is similar to the polygon <var>FGHKL</var>, the angle <var>BAE</var> is equal to the angle <var>GFL</var>; and, as <var>BA</var> is to <var>AE</var>, so is <var>GF</var> to <var>FL</var>. [<a href="/books/6/#def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Since then <var>ABE</var>, <var>FGL</var> are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional, therefore the triangle <var>ABE</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>FGL</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.6">VI. 6</a>] so that it is also similar; [<a href="#elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1">VI. 4 and Def. 1</a>] therefore the angle <var>ABE</var> is equal to the angle <var>FGL</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But the whole angle <var>ABC</var> is also equal to the whole angle <var>FGH</var> because of the similarity of the polygons; therefore the remaining angle <var>EBC</var> is equal to the angle <var>LGH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And, since, because of the similarity of the triangles <var>ABE</var>, <var>FGL</var>, as <var>EB</var> is to <var>BA</var>, so is <var>LG</var> to <var>GF</var>, and moreover also, because of the similarity of the polygons, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>FG</var> to <var>GH</var>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>EB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>LG</var> to <var>GH</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] that is, the sides about the equal angles <var>EBC</var>, <var>LGH</var> are proportional; therefore the triangle <var>EBC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>LGH</var>, [<a href="/books/6/#prop.6">VI. 6</a>] so that the triangle <var>EBC</var> is also similar to the triangle <lb n="40"/><var>LGH</var>. [<a href="#elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1">VI. 4 and Def. 1</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason the triangle <var>ECD</var> is also similar to the triangle <var>LHK</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the similar polygons <var>ABCDE</var>, <var>FGHKL</var> have been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude. </p>
  
    <p>I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and <var>ABE</var>, <var>EBC</var>, <var>ECD</var> are antecedents, while <var>FGL</var>, <var>LGH</var>, <var>LHK</var> are their consequents, and that the polygon <var>ABCDE</var>
       has to the polygon <var>FGHKL</var> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is <var>AB</var> to <var>FG</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For let <var>AC</var>, <var>FH</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then since, because of the similarity of the polygons, the angle <var>ABC</var> is equal to the angle <var>FGH</var>, and, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>FG</var> to <var>GH</var>, the triangle <var>ABC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>FGH</var>; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.6">VI. 6</a>] therefore the angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the angle <var>GFH</var>, and the angle <var>BCA</var> to the angle <var>GHF</var>.
       </p>
  
    <p>And, since the angle <var>BAM</var> is equal to the angle <var>GFN</var>, and the angle <var>ABM</var> is also equal to the angle <var>FGN</var>, therefore the remaining angle <var>AMB</var> is also equal to the remaining angle <var>FNG</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <var>ABM</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>FGN</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <var>BMC</var> is also equiangular with the triangle <var>GNH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, proportionally, as <var>AM</var> is to <var>MB</var>, so is <var>FN</var> to <var>NG</var>, and, as <var>BM</var> is to <var>MC</var>, so is <var>GN</var> to <var>NH</var>; so that, in addition, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>AM</var> is to <var>MC</var>, so is <var>FN</var> to <var>NH</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>AM</var> is to <var>MC</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABM</var> to <var>MBC</var>, and <var>AME</var> to <var>EMC</var>; for they are to one another as their bases. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.12">V. 12</a>] therefore, as the triangle <var>AMB</var> is to <var>BMC</var>, so is <var>ABE</var> to <var>CBE</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>AMB</var> is to <var>BMC</var>, so is <var>AM</var> to <var>MC</var>; therefore also, as <var>AM</var> is to <var>MC</var>, so is the triangle <var>ABE</var> to the triangle <var>EBC</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as <var>FN</var> is to <var>NH</var>, so is the triangle <var>FGL</var> to the triangle <var>GLH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And, as <var>AM</var> is to <var>MC</var>, so is <var>FN</var> to <var>NH</var>; therefore also, as the triangle <var>ABE</var> is to the triangle <var>BEC</var>, so is the triangle <var>FGL</var> to the triangle <var>GLH</var>; and, alternately, as the triangle <var>ABE</var> is to the triangle <var>FGL</var>, so is the triangle <var>BEC</var> to the triangle <var>GLH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove, if <var>BD</var>, <var>GK</var> be joined, that, as the triangle <var>BEC</var> is to the triangle <var>LGH</var>, so also is the triangle <var>ECD</var> to the triangle <var>LHK</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And since, as the triangle <var>ABE</var> is to the triangle <var>FGL</var>, so is <var>EBC</var> to <var>LGH</var>, and further <var>ECD</var> to <var>LHK</var>, therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.12">V. 12</a> therefore, as the triangle <var>ABE</var> is to the triangle <var>FGL</var>, so is the polygon <var>ABCDE</var> to the polygon <var>FGHKL</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But the triangle <var>ABE</var> has to the triangle <var>FGL</var> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <var>AB</var> has to the corresponding side <var>FG</var>; for similar triangles are in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.19">VI. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the polygon <var>ABCDE</var> also has to the polygon <var>FGHKL</var> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <var>AB</var> has to the corresponding side <var>FG</var>. </p>
