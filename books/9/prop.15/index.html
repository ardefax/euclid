  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B, C, three numbers in continued proportion, be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that any two of the numbers A, B, C whatever added together are prime to the remaining number, namely A, B to C; B, C to A; and further A, C to B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let two numbers DE, EF, the least of those which have the same ratio with A, B, C, be taken. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.2">VIII. 2</a>] </p>
  
    <p>It is then manifest that DE by multiplying itself has made A, and by multiplying EF has made B, and, further, EF by multiplying itself has made C. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.2">VIII. 2</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now, since DE, EF are least, they are prime to one another. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.22">VII. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.28">VII. 28</a>] therefore DF is also prime to each of the numbers DE, EF. </p>
  
    <p>But further DE is also prime to EF; therefore DF, DE are prime to EF. </p>
  
    <p>But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.24">VII. 24</a>] so that the product of FD, DE is prime to EF; hence the product of FD, DE is also prime to the square on EF. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.25">VII. 25</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the product of FD, DE is the square on DE together with the product of DE, EF; [<a href="/books/2/#prop.3">II. 3</a>] therefore the square on DE together with the product of DE, EF is prime to the square on EF. </p>
  
    <p>And the square on DE is A, the product of DE, EF is B, and the square on EF is C; therefore A, B added together are prime to C. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that B, C added together are prime to A. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that A, C added together are also prime to B. </p>
  
    <p>For, since DF is prime to each of the numbers DE, EF, the square on DF is also prime to the product of DE, EF. [<a href="#elem.7.24 elem.7.25">VII. 24, 25</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the squares on DE, EF together with twice the product of DE, EF are equal to the square on DF; [<a href="/books/2/#prop.4">II. 4</a>] therefore the squares on DE, EF together with twice the product of DE, EF are prime to the product of DE, EF. </p>
  
    <p><foreign lang="la">Separando</foreign>, the squares on DE, EF together with once the product of DE, EF are prime to the product of DE, EF. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign> again, the squares on DE, EF are prime to the product of DE, EF. </p>
  
    <p>And the square on DE is A, the product of DE, EF is B, and the square on EF is C. </p>
