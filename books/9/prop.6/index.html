    <p>For let the number A by multiplying itself make the cube number B; I say that A is also cube. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let A by multiplying B make C. </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, A by multiplying itself has made B, and by multiplying B has made C, therefore C is cube. </p>
  
    <p>And, since A by multiplying itself has made B, therefore A measures B according to the units in itself. </p>
  
    <p>But the unit also measures A according to the units in it. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as the unit is to A, so is A to B. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since A by multiplying B has made C, therefore B measures C according to the units in A. </p>
  
    <p>But the unit also measures A according to the units in it. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as the unit is to A, so is B to C. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as the unit is to A, so is A to B; therefore also, as A is to B, so is B to C. </p>
  
    <p>And, since B, C are cube, they are similar solid numbers. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between B, C. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.19">VIII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as B is to C, so is A to B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between A, B also. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>
