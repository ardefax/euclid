    <p>Let A, B, C be the given three numbers, and let it be required to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now either they are not in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are not prime to one another; or they are not in continued proportion, nor are the extremes of them prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>If then A, B, C are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them A, C are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to them. [<a href="/books/9/#prop.17">IX. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>&lt;*&gt;Next, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, the extremes being again prime to one another; I say that in this case also it is impossible to find a fourth proportional to them. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let D have been found, so that, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">C</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and let it be contrived that, as B is to C, so is D to E. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and, as B is to C, so is D to E, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to C, so is C to E. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.14">VII. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But A, C are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A measures C as antecedent antecedent. </p>
  
    <p>But it also measures itself; therefore A measures A, C which are prime to one another: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional to A, B, C.&lt;*&gt; </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A, B, C be again in continued proportion, but let A, C not be prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>I say that it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. </p>
  
    <p>For let B by multiplying C make D; therefore A either measures D or does not measure it. </p>
  
    <p>First, let it measure it according to E; therefore A by multiplying E has made D. </p>
  
    <p>But, further, B has also by multiplying C made D; therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, C; therefore, proportionally, as A is to B, so is C to E; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] therefore E has been found a fourth proportional to A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A not measure D; I say that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to A, B, C. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let E have been found; therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, C. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the product of B, C is D; therefore the product of A, E is also equal to D. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A by multiplying E has made D; therefore A measures D according to E, so that A measures D. </p>
  
    <p>But it also does not measure it: which is absurd. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional number to A, B, C when A does not measure D. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, nor the extremes prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>And let B by multiplying C make D. </p>

    <p>Similarly then it can be proved that, if A measures D, it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them, but, if it does not measure it, impossible. Q. E. D.</p>
