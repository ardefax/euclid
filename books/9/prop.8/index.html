       If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, the third from the unit will be square, as will also those which successively leave out one; the fourth will be cube, as will also all those which leave out two; and the seventh will be at once cube and square, as will also those which leave out five.

    <p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, E, F, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion; I say that B, the third from the unit, is square, as are also all those which leave out one; C, the fourth, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two; and F, the seventh, is at once cube and square, as are also all those which leave out five. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For since, as the unit is to A, so is A to B, therefore the unit measures the number A the same number of times that A measures B. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the unit measures the number A according to the units in it; therefore A also measures B according to the units in A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A by multiplying itself has made B; therefore B is square. </p>
  
    <p>And, since B, C, D are in continued proportion, and B is square, therefore D is also square. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.22">VIII. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason F is also square. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one are square. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that C, the fourth from the unit, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as the unit is to A, so is B to C, therefore the unit measures the number A the same number of times that B measures C. </p>
  
    <p>But the unit measures the number A according to the units in A; therefore B also measures C according to the units in A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A by multiplying B has made C. </p>
  
    <p>Since then A by multiplying itself has made B, and by multiplying B has made C, therefore C is cube. </p>
  
    <p>And, since C, D, E, F are in continued proportion, and C is cube, therefore F is also cube. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.23">VIII. 23</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved square; therefore the seventh from the unit is both cube and square. </p>
