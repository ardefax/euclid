    <p>For let the cube number A by multiplying itself make B; I say that B is cube. </p>
  
    <p>For let C, the side of A, be taken, and let C by multiplying itself make D. </p>
  
    <p>It is then manifest that C by multiplying D has made A. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since C by multiplying itself has made D, therefore C measures D according to the units in itself. </p>
  
    <p>But further the unit also measures C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to C, so is C to D. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since C by multiplying D has made A, therefore D measures A according to the units in C. </p>
  
    <p>But the unit also measures C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to C, so is D to A. </p>
  
    <p>But, as the unit is to C, so is C to D; therefore also, as the unit is to C, so is C to D, and D to A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore between the unit and the number A two mean proportional numbers C, D have fallen in continued proportion. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since A by multiplying itself has made B, therefore A measures B according to the units in itself. </p>
  
    <p>But the unit also measures A according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to A, so is A to B. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But between the unit and A two mean proportional numbers have fallen; therefore two mean proportional numbers will also fall between A, B. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.8">VIII. 8</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube. [<a href="/books/8/#prop.23">VIII. 23</a>] </p>
