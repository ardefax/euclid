  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B be the given two numbers, and let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them. </p>
  
    <p>Now A, B are either prime to one another or not. </p>
  
    <p>And, if they are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them. [<a href="/books/9/#prop.16">IX. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A, B not be prime to one another, and let B by multiplying itself make C. </p>
  
    <p>Then A either measures C or does not measure it. 
      </p>
  
    <p>First, let it measure it according to D; therefore A by multiplying D has made C. </p>
  
    <p>But, further, B has also by multiplying itself made C; therefore the product of A, D is equal to the square on B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as A is to B, so is B to D; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] therefore a third proportional number D has been found to A, B. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A not measure C; I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number to A, B. </p>
  
    <p>For, if possible, let D, such third proportional, have been found. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the product of A, D is equal to the square on B. </p>
  
    <p>But the square on B is C; therefore the product of A, D is equal to C. </p>
  
    <p>Hence A by multiplying D has made C; therefore A measures C according to D. </p>
  
    <p>But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it: which is absurd. </p>
