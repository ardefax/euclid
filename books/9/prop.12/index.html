  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, beginning from an unit, and in continued proportion; I say that, by however many prime numbers D is measured, A will also be measured by the same. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let D be measured by any prime number E; I say that E measures A. </p>
  
    <p>For suppose it does not; now E is prime, and any prime number is prime to any which it does not measure; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.29">VII. 29</a>] therefore E, A are prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>And, since E measures D, let it measure it according to F, therefore E by multiplying F has made D. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since A measures D according to the units in C, [<a href="#elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1">IX. 11 and Por.</a>] therefore A by multiplying C has made D. </p>
  
    <p>But, further, E has also by multiplying F made D; therefore the product of A, C is equal to the product of E, F. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as A is to E, so is F to C. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures C. </p>
  
    <p>Let it measure it according to G; therefore E by multiplying G has made C. </p>
  
    <p>But, further, by the theorem before this, A has also by multiplying B made C. [<a href="#elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1">IX. 11 and Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the product of A, B is equal to the product of E, G. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as A is to E, so is G to B. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent: [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures B. </p>
  
    <p>Let it measure it according to H; therefore E by multiplying H has made B. </p>
  
    <p>But further A has also by multiplying itself made B; [<a href="/books/9/#prop.8">IX. 8</a>] therefore the product of E, H is equal to the square on A. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as E is to A, so is A to H. [<a href="/books/7/#prop.19">VII. 19</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href="/books/7/#prop.21">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href="/books/7/#prop.20">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures A, as antecedent antecedent. </p>
  
    <p>But, again, it also does not measure it: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore E, A are not prime to one another. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore they are composite to one another. </p>
  
    <p>But numbers composite to one another are measured by some number. [<a href="/books/7/#def.14">VII. Def. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since E is by hypothesis prime, and the prime is not measured by any number other than itself, therefore E measures A, E, so that E measures A. </p>
  
    <p>[But it also measures D; therefore E measures A, D.] </p>

  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that, by however many prime numbers D is measured, A will also be measured by the same. Q. E. D.</p>
