  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>For let a straight line <var>AB</var> be cut at random at the point <var>C</var>;</p>
  
    <p>I say that four times the rectangle contained by <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var> together with the square on <var>AC</var> is equal to the square described on <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var> as on one straight line. </p>
  
    <p>For let [the straight line] <var>BD</var> be produced in a straight line [with <var>AB</var>], and let <var>BD</var> be made equal to <var>CB</var>; let the square <var>AEFD</var> be described on <var>AD</var>, and let the figure be drawn double.</p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>CB</var> is equal to <var>BD</var>, while <var>CB</var> is equal to <var>GK</var>, and <var>BD</var> to <var>KN</var>, therefore <var>GK</var> is also equal to <var>KN</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason <var>QR</var> is also equal to <var>RP</var>.</p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>BC</var> is equal to <var>BD</var>, and <var>GK</var> to <var>KN</var>, therefore <var>CK</var> is also equal to <var>KD</var>, and <var>GR</var> to <var>RN</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.36">I. 36</a>]</p>
  
    <p>But <var>CK</var> is equal to <var>RN</var>, for they are complements of the parallelogram <var>CP</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.43">I. 43</a>] therefore <var>KD</var> is also equal to <var>GR</var>; therefore the four areas <var>DK</var>, <var>CK</var>, <var>GR</var>, <var>RN</var> are equal to one another. Therefore the four are quadruple of <var>CK</var>.</p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>CB</var> is equal to <var>BD</var>, while <var>BD</var> is equal to <var>BK</var>, that is <var>CG</var>, and <var>CB</var> is equal to <var>GK</var>, that is <var>GQ</var>, therefore <var>CG</var> is also equal to <var>GQ</var>.</p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>CG</var> is equal to <var>GQ</var>, and <var>QR</var> to <var>RP</var>, <var>AG</var> is also equal to <var>MQ</var>, and <var>QL</var> to <var>RF</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.36">I. 36</a>]</p>
  
    <p>But <var>MQ</var> is equal to <var>QL</var>, for they are complements of the parallelogram <var>ML</var>; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.43">I. 43</a>] therefore <var>AG</var> is also equal to <var>RF</var>; therefore the four areas <var>AG</var>, <var>MQ</var>, <var>QL</var>, <var>RF</var> are equal to one another. Therefore the four are quadruple of <var>AG</var>. But the four areas <var>CK</var>, <var>KD</var>, <var>GR</var>, <var>RN</var> were proved to be quadruple of <var>CK</var>; therefore the eight areas, which contain the gnomon <var>STU</var>, are quadruple of <var>AK</var>.</p>
  
    <p>Now, since <var>AK</var> is the rectangle <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var>, for <var>BK</var> is equal to <var>BD</var>, therefore four times the rectangle <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var> is quadruple of <var>AK</var>.</p>
  
    <p>But the gnomon <var>STU</var> was also proved to be quadruple of <var>AK</var>; therefore four times the rectangle <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var> is equal to the gnomon <var>STU</var>.</p>
  
    <p>Let <var>OH</var>, which is equal to the square on <var>AC</var>, be added to each; therefore four times the rectangle <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var> together with the square on <var>AC</var> is equal to the gnomon <var>STU</var> and <var>OH</var>.</p>
  
    <p>But the gnomon <var>STU</var> and <var>OH</var> are the whole square <var>AEFD</var>, which is described on <var>AD</var>. therefore four times the rectangle <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var> together with the square on <var>AC</var> is equal to the square on <var>AD</var></p>
  
    <p>But <var>BD</var> is equal to <var>BC</var>; therefore four times the rectangle contained by <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var> together with the square on <var>AC</var> is equal to the square on <var>AD</var>, that is to the square described on <var>AB</var> and <var>BC</var> as on one straight line.</p>
