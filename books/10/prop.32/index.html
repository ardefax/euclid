       To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a medial rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.

  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let there be set out three rational straight lines A, B, C commensurable in square only, and such that the square on A is greater than the square on C by the square on a straight line commensurable with A, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.29">X. 29</a>] and let the square on D be equal to the rectangle A, B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on D is medial; therefore D is also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let the rectangle D, E be equal to the rectangle B, C. </p>
  
    <p>Then since, as the rectangle A, B is to the rectangle B, C, so is A to C; while the square on D is equal to the rectangle A, B, and the rectangle D, E is equal to the rectangle B, C, therefore, as A is to C, so is the square on D to the rectangle D, E. </p>
  
    <p>But, as the square on D is to the rectangle D, E, so is D to E; therefore also, as A is to C, so is D to E. </p>
  
    <p>But A is commensurable with C in square only; therefore D is also commensurable with E in square only. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But D is medial; therefore E is also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>
  
    <p>And, since, as A is to C, so is D to E, while the square on A is greater than the square on C by the square on a straight line commensurable with A, therefore also the square on D will be greater than the square on E by the square on a straight line commensurable with D.[<a href="/books/10/#prop.14">X. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that the rectangle D, E is also medial. </p>
  
    <p>For, since the rectangle B, C is equal to the rectangle D, E, while the rectangle B, C is medial, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] therefore the rectangle D, E is also medial. </p>

  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>Therefore two medial straight lines D, E, commensurable in square only, and containing a medial rectangle, have been found such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater. </p>
