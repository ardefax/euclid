    <p>
       If there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into parts which are incommensurable, the square on the greater will be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.

  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>And, if the square on the greater be greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater, and if there be applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into parts which are incommensurable. </p>
  
    <p>Let A, BC be two unequal straight lines, of which BC is the greater, and to BC let there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, A, and deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle BD, DC, [cf. <a href="/books/10/#16.l.1">Lemma before X. 17</a>]  and let BD be incommensurable in length with DC; I say that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC. </p>
  
    <p>For, with the same construction as before, we can prove similarly that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD. </p>
  
    <p>It is to be proved that BC is incommensurable in length with DF. </p>
  
    <p>Since BD is incommensurable in length with DC, therefore BC is also incommensurable in length with CD. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.16">X. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But DC is commensurable with the sum of BF, DC; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] therefore BC is also incommensurable with the sum of BF, DC; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] so that BC is also incommensurable in length with the remainder FD. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.16">X. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD; therefore the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC. </p>
  
    <p>Again, let the square on BC be greater than the square on A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC, and let there be applied to BC a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on A and deficient by a square figure. Let this be the rectangle BD, DC. </p>
  
    <p>It is to be proved that BD is incommensurable in length with DC. </p>
  
    <p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD. </p>
  
    <p>But the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BC; therefore BC is incommensurable in length with FD. so that BC is also incommensurable with the remainder, the sum of BF, DC. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.16">X. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the sum of BF, DC is commensurable in length with DC; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] therefore BC is also incommensurable in length with DC, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] so that, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, BD is also incommensurable in length with DC.
