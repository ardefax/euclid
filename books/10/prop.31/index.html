    <p>Let there be set out two rational straight lines A, B commensurable in square only and such that the square on A, being the greater, is greater than the square on B the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with A. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.29">X. 29</a>] 
      </p>
  
    <p>And let the square on C be equal to the rectangle A, B. </p>
  
    <p>Now the rectangle A, B is medial; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] therefore the square on C is also medial; therefore C is also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let the rectangle C, D be equal to the square on B. </p>
  
    <p>Now the square on B is rational; therefore the rectangle C, D is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>And since, as A is to B, so is the rectangle A, B to the square on B, while the square on C is equal to the rectangle A, B, and the rectangle C, D is equal to the square on B, therefore, as A is to B, so is the square on C to the rectangle C, D. </p>
  
    <p>But, as the square on C is to the rectangle C, D, so is C to D; therefore also, as A is to B, so is C to D. </p>
  
    <p>But A is commensurable with B in square only; therefore C is also commensurable with D in square only. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And C is medial; therefore D is also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.23">X. 23</a>, addition] </p>
  
    <p>And since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on a straight line commensurable with A, therefore also the square on C is greater than the square on D by the square on a straight line commensurable with C. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.14">X. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore two medial straight lines C, D, commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle, have been found, and the square on C is greater than the square on D by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with C. </p>

  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>Similarly also it can be proved that the square on C exceeds the square on D by the square on a straight line incommensurable with C, when the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on a straight line incommensurable with A. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.30">X. 30</a>]</p>
