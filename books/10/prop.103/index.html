    <p>Let AB be an apotome, and let CD be commensurable in length with AB;  I say that CD is also an apotome and the same in order with AB. </p>
  
    <p>For, since AB is an apotome, let BE be the annex to it; therefore AE, EB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it be contrived that the ratio of BE to DF is the same as the ratio of AB to CD; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.12">VI. 12</a>] therefore also, as one is to one, so are all to all; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.12">V. 12</a>] therefore also, as the whole AE is to the whole CF, so is AB to CD. </p>
  
    <p>But AB is commensurable in length with CD. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore AE is also commensurable with CF, and BE with DF. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And AE, EB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore CF, FD are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now since, as AE is to CF, so is BE to DF, alternately therefore, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the square on AE is greater than the square on EB either by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
  
    <p>If then the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE, the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD by the square on a straight line commensurable with CF. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.14">X. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, if AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, CF is so also, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.12">X. 12</a>] if BE, then DF also, [id.] and, if neither of the straight lines AE, EB, then neither of the straight lines CF, FD. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on a straight line incommensurable with AE, the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD by the square on a straight line incommensurable with CF. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.14">X. 14</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, if AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, CF is so also, if BE, then DF also, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.12">X. 12</a>] and, if neither of the straight lines AE, EB, then neither of the straight lines CF, FD. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
