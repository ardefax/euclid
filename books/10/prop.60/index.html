  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let AB be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at C, so that AC is the greater term; let a rational straight line DE be set out, and let DEFG equal to the square on AB be applied to DE producing DG as its breadth; I say that DG is a first binomial straight line. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let there be applied to DE the rectangle DH equal to the square on AC, and KL equal to the square on BC; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle AC, CB, is equal to MF. </p>
  
    <p>Let MG be bisected at N, and let NO be drawn parallel [to ML or GF]. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore each of the rectangles MO, NF is equal to once the rectangle AC, CB. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since AB is a binomial divided into its terms at C, therefore AC, CB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.36">X. 36</a>] therefore the squares on AC, CB are rational and commensurable with one another, so that the sum of the squares on AC, CB is also rational. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.15">X. 15</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And it is equal to DL; therefore DL is rational. </p>
  
    <p>And it is applied to the rational straight line DE; therefore DM is rational and commensurable in length with DE. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.20">X. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since AC, CB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore twice the rectangle AC, CB, that is MF, is medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And it is applied to the rational straight line ML; therefore MG is also rational and incommensurable in length with ML, that is, DE. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.22">X. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But MD is also rational and is commensurable in length with DE; therefore DM is incommensurable in length with MG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And they are rational; therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore DG is binomial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.36">X. 36</a>] </p>
  
    <p>It is next to be proved that it is also a first binomial straight line. </p>
  
    <p>Since the rectangle AC, CB is a mean proportional between the squares on AC, CB, [cf. <a href="/books/10/#53.l.1">Lemma after X. 53</a>] therefore MO is also a mean proportional between DH, KL. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as DH is to MO, so is MO to KL, that is, as DK is to MN, so is MN to MK; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on MN. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.17">VI. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the square on AC is commensurable with the square on CB, DH is also commensurable with KL, so that DK is also commensurable with KM. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the squares on AC, CB are greater than twice the rectangle AC, CB, [<a href="/books/10/#59.l.1">Lemma</a>] therefore DL is also greater than MF, so that DM is also greater than MG. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on MN, that is, to the fourth part of the square on MG, and DK is commensurable with KM. </p>
  
    <p>But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into commensurable parts, the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.17">X. 17</a>] therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with DM. </p>
  
    <p>And DM, MG are rational, and DM, which is the greater term, is commensurable in length with the rational straight line DE set out. </p>
