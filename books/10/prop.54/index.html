    <p>For let the area AC be contained by the rational straight line AB and the first binomial AD; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the area AC is the irrational straight line which is called binomial. </p>
  
    <p>For, since AD is a first binomial straight line, let it be divided into its terms at E, and let AE be the greater term. </p>
  
    <p>It is then manifest that AE, ED are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE, and AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line AB set out. [<a href="/books/10/#def.2.1">X. Deff. II. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let ED be bisected at the point F. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Then, since the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with AE, therefore, if there be applied to the greater AE a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, that is, to the square on EF, and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into commensurable parts. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.17">X. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let then the rectangle AG, GE equal to the square on EF be applied to AE; therefore AG is commensurable in length with EG. </p>
  
    <p>Let GH, EK, FL be drawn from G, E, F parallel to either of the straight lines AB, CD; let the square SN be constructed equal to the parallelogram AH, and the square NQ equal to GK, [<a href="/books/2/#prop.14">II. 14</a>] and let them be placed so that MN is in a straight line with NO; therefore RN is also in a straight line with NP. </p>
  
    <p>And let the parallelogram SQ be completed; therefore SQ is a square. [Lemma] </p>
  
    <p>Now, since the rectangle AG, GE is equal to the square on EF, therefore, as AG is to EF, so is FE to EG; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.17">VI. 17</a>] therefore also, as AH is to EL, so is EL to KG; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore EL is a mean proportional between AH, GK. </p>
  
    <p>But AH is equal to SN, and GK to NQ; therefore EL is a mean proportional between SN, NQ. </p>
  
    <p>But MR is also a mean proportional between the same SN, NQ; [Lemma] therefore EL is equal to MR, so that it is also equal to PO. </p>
  
    <p>But AH, GK are also equal to SN, NQ; therefore the whole AC is equal to the whole SQ, that is, to the square on MO; therefore MO is the <quote>side</quote>
 of AC. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that MO is binomial. </p>
  
    <p>For, since AG is commensurable with GE, therefore AE is also commensurable with each of the straight lines AG, GE. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.15">X. 15</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AE is also, by hypothesis, commensurable with AB; therefore AG, GE are also commensurable with AB. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.12">X. 12</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And AB is rational; therefore each of the straight lines AG, GE is also rational; therefore each of the rectangles AH, GK is rational, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.19">X. 19</a>] and AH is commensurable with GK. </p>
  
    <p>But AH is equal to SN, and GK to NQ; therefore SN, NQ, that is, the squares on MN, NO, are rational and commensurable. </p>
  
    <p>And, since AE is incommensurable in length with ED, while AE is commensurable with AG, and DE is commensurable with EF, therefore AG is also incommensurable with EF, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] so that AH is also incommensurable with EL. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AH is equal to SN, and EL to MR; therefore SN is also incommensurable with MR. </p>
  
    <p>But, as SN is to MR, so is PN to NR; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] therefore PN is incommensurable with NR. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But PN is equal to MN, and NR to NO; therefore MN is incommensurable with NO. </p>
  
    <p>And the square on MN is commensurable with the square on NO, and each is rational; therefore MN, NO are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p>
