    <p>And, if the square on the first be greater than the square on the second by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the first, the square on the third will also be greater than the square on the fourth by the square on a straight line in-
       commensurable with the third. </p>
  
    <p>Let A, B, C, D be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D; and let the square on A be greater than the square on B by the square on E, and let the square on C be greater than the square on D by the square on F; I say that, if A is commensurable with E, C is also commensurable with F, and, if A is incommensurable with E, C is also incommensurable with F. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For since, as A is to B, so is C to D, therefore also, as the square on A is to the square on B, so is the square on C to the square on D. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.22">VI. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the squares on E, B are equal to the square on A, and the squares on D, F are equal to the square on C. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as the squares on E, B are to the square on B, so are the squares on D, F to the square on D; therefore, <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, as the square on E is to the square on B, so is the square on F to the square on D; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.17">V. 17</a>] therefore also, as E is to B, so is F to D; [<a href="/books/6/#prop.22">VI. 22</a>] therefore, inversely, as B is to E, so is D to F. </p>
  
    <p>But, as A is to B, so also is C to D; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to E, so is C to F. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, if A is commensurable with E, C is also commensurable with F, and, if A is incommensurable with E, C is also incommensurable with F. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>

    <p>Therefore etc.<note type="crit" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">3, 5, 8, 10.

 and similarly in all like phrases throughout the Book. For clearness' sake I substitute <quote>the first,</quote>
