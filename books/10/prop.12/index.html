    <p>For let each of the magnitudes A, B be commensurable with C; I say that A is also commensurable with B. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, since A is commensurable with C, therefore A has to C the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.5">X. 5</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it have the ratio which D has to E. </p>
  
    <p>Again, since C is commensurable with B, therefore C has to B the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.5">X. 5</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it have the ratio which F has to G. </p>
  
    <p>And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which D has to E and that which F has to G, let the numbers H, K, L be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. <a href="/books/8/#prop.4">VIII. 4</a>] so that, as D is to E, so is H to K, and, as <hi rend="ital">F</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">K</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, as A is to C, so is D to E, while, as D is to E, so is H to K, therefore also, as A is to C, so is H to K. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since, as C is to B, so is F to G, while, as F is to G, so is K to L, therefore also, as C is to B, so is K to L. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But also, as A is to C, so is H to K; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to B, so is H to L. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A has to B the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore A is commensurable with B. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
