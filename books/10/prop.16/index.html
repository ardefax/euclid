    <p>For let the two incommensurable magnitudes AB, BC be added together; I say that the whole AC is also incommensurable with each of the magnitudes AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>For, if CA, AB are not incommensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
  
    <p>Let it measure them, if possible, and let it be D. </p>
  
    <p>Since then D measures CA, AB, therefore it will also measure the remainder BC. 
      </p>
  
    <p>But it measures AB also; therefore D measures AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore AB, BC are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no magnitude will measure CA, AB; therefore CA, AB are incommensurable. [<a href="/books/10/#def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that AC, CB are also incommensurable. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore AC is incommensurable with each of the magnitudes AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>Next, let AC be incommensurable with one of the magnitudes AB, BC. </p>
  
    <p>First, let it be incommensurable with AB; I say that AB, BC are also incommensurable. </p>
  
    <p>For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
  
    <p>Let it measure them, and let it be D. </p>
  
    <p>Since then D measures AB, BC. therefore it will also measure the whole AC. </p>
  
    <p>But it measures AB also; therefore D measures CA, AB. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore CA, AB are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore no magnitude will measure AB, BC; therefore AB, BC are incommensurable. [<a href="/books/10/#def.1">X. Def. 1</a>] </p>
