  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that AB has not to either of them the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and let there also be another number D which is not square and which has not to either of the numbers BA, AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let any rational straight line E be set out, and let it be contrived that, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the square on FG; [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on E is commensurable with the square on FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And E is rational; therefore FG is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since D has not to AB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on E to the square on FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore E is incommensurable in length with FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, let it be contrived that, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH. [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square on HG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on HG is rational; therefore HG is rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on FG to the square on GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore FH is binomial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.36">X. 36</a>] </p>
  
    <p>It is next to be proved that it is also a sixth binomial straight line. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the square on FG, and also, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as D is to AC, so is the square on E to the square on GH. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But D has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on E to the square on GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore E is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved incommensurable with FG; therefore each of the straight lines FG, GH is incommensurable in length with E. </p>
  
    <p>And, since, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH. </p>
  
    <p>Let then the squares on GH, K be equal to the square on FG; therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as AB is to BC, so is the square on FG to the square on K. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AB has not to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; so that neither has the square on FG to the square on K the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore FG is incommensurable in length with K; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH by the square on a straight line incommensurable with FG. </p>
  
    <p>And FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational straight line E set out. </p>
