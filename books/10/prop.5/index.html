  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let A, B be commensurable magnitudes; I say that A has to B the ratio which a number has to a number. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A, B are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them. </p>
  
    <p>Let it measure them, and let it be C. 
      </p>
  
    <p>And, as many times as C measures A, so many units let there be in D; and, as many times as C measures B, so many units let there be in E. </p>
  
    <p>Since then C measures A according to the units in D, while the unit also measures D according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number D the same number of times as the magnitude C measures A; therefore, as C is to A, so is the unit to D; [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] therefore, inversely, as A is to C, so is D to the unit. [cf. <a href="/books/5/#7.p.1">V. 7, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since C measures B according to the units in E, while the unit also measures E according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures E the same number of times as C measures B; therefore, as C is to B, so is the unit to E. </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to the unit; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is the number <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>.
