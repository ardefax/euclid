    <p>Let A, B, C, D be four magnitudes in proportion, so that, as A is to B, so is C to D, and let A be commensurable with B;  I say that C will also be commensurable with D. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A is commensurable with B, therefore A has to B the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.5">X. 5</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as A is to B, so is C to D; therefore C also has to D the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore C is commensurable with D. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Next, let A be incommensurable with B; I say that C will also be incommensurable with D. </p>
  
    <p>For, since A is incommensurable with B, therefore A has not to B the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.7">X. 7</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as A is to B, so is C to D; therefore neither has C to D the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore C is incommensurable with D. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.8">X. 8</a>] </p>
