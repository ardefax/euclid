  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let a rational straight line A be set out, and let CG be commensurable in length with A; therefore CG is rational. </p>
  
    <p>Let two numbers DF, FE be set out such that DE again has not to either of the numbers DF, FE the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and let it be contrived that, as FE is to ED, so is the square on CG to the square on GB. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on GB is also rational; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] therefore BG is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>Now since, as DE is to EF, so is the square on BG to the square on GC, while DE has not to EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on GC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is incommensurable in length with GC. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And both are rational; therefore BG, GC are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore BC is an apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a fifth apotome. </p>
  
    <p>For let the square on H be that by which the square on BG is greater than the square on GC. </p>
  
    <p>Since then, as the square on BG is to the square on GC, so is DE to EF, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as ED is to DF, so is the square on BG to the square on H. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But ED has not to DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is incommensurable in length with H. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC by the square on H; therefore the square on GB is greater than the square on GC by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with GB. </p>
  
    <p>And the annex CG is commensurable in length with the rational straight line A set out; therefore BC is a fifth apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.5">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] </p>
