  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that AB neither has to BC, nor yet to AC, the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Let a rational straight line D be set out, and let EF be commensurable in length with D; therefore EF is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>Let it be contrived that, as the number BA is to AC, so is the square on EF to the square on FG; [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on EF is commensurable with the square on FG; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] therefore FG is also rational. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on EF to the square on FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore EF is incommensurable in length with FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore EF, FG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that EG is binomial. </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a fourth binomial straight line. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as BA is to AC, so is the square on EF to the square on FG, therefore the square on EF is greater than the square on FG. </p>
  
    <p>Let then the squares on FG, H be equal to the square on EF; therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as the number AB is to BC, so is the square on EF to the square on H. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AB has not to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on EF to the square on H the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore EF is incommensurable in length with H; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on EF is greater than the square on GF by the square on a straight line incommensurable with EF. </p>
  
    <p>And EF, FG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and EF is commensurable in length with D. </p>
