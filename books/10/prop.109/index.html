    <p>For from the medial area BC let the rational area BD be subtracted. </p>
  
    <p>I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of the remainder EC becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let a rational straight line FG be set out, and let the areas be similarly applied. </p>
  
    <p>It follows then that FH is rational and incommensurable in length with FG, while KF is rational and commensurable in length with FG; therefore FH, FK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] therefore KH is an apotome, and FK the annex to it. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Now the square on HF is greater than the square on FK either by the square on a straight line commensurable with HF or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it. </p>
  
    <p>If then the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on a straight line commensurable with HF, while the annex FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line FG set out, KH is a second apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.2">X. Deff. III. 2</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But FG is rational; so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of LH, that is, of EC, is a first apotome of a medial straight line. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.92">X. 92</a>] </p>

  <section id="" class="qed">
  
  
  
    <p>But, if the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with HF, while the annex FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line FG set out, KH is a fifth apotome; [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.5">X. Deff. III. 5</a>] so that the <quote>side</quote>
 of EC is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.95">X. 95</a>]</p>
