    <p>For let the two magnitudes A, B have to one another the ratio which the number D has to the number E; I say that the magnitudes A, B are commensurable. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let A be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in D, and let C be equal to one of them; and let F be made up of as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in E. </p>
  
    <p>Since then there are in A as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in D, whatever part the unit is of D, the same part is C of A also; therefore, as C is to A, so is the unit to D. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the unit measures the number D; therefore C also measures A. </p>
  
    <p>And since, as C is to A, so is the unit to D, therefore, inversely, as A is to C, so is the number D to the unit. [cf. <a href="/books/5/#7.p.1">V. 7, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since there are in F as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in E, therefore, as C is to F, so is the unit to E. [<a href="/books/7/#def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved that, as <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">D</hi> to the unit;
       therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to F, so is D to E. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">v. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But, as D is to E, so is A to B; therefore also, as A is to B, so is it to F also. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes B, F; therefore B is equal to F. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.9">V. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But C measures F; therefore it measures B also. </p>
  
    <p>Further it measures A also; therefore C measures A, B. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore A is commensurable with B. </p>
