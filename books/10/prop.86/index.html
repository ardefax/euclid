    <p>Let a rational straight line A be set out, and GC commensurable in length with A; therefore GC is rational. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let two square numbers DE, EF be set out, and let their difference DF not be square. </p>
  
    <p>Now let it be contrived that, as FD is to DE, so is the square on CG to the square on GB. [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on CG is commensurable with the square on GB. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the square on CG is rational; therefore the square on GB is also rational; therefore BG is rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since the square on GC has not to the square on GB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, CG is incommensurable in length with GB. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And both are rational; therefore CG, GB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore BC is an apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a second apotome. </p>
  
    <p>For let the square on H be that by which the square on BG is greater than the square on GC. </p>
  
    <p>Since then, as the square on BG is to the square on GC, so is the number ED to the number DF, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as the square on BG is to the square on H, so is DE to EF. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And each of the numbers DE, EF is square; therefore the square on BG has to the square on H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is commensurable in length with H. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC by the square on H; therefore the square on BG is greater than the square on GC
       by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with BG. </p>
  
    <p>And CG, the annex, is commensurable with the rational straight line A set out. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore BC is a second apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.2">X. Deff. III. 2</a>] </p>
