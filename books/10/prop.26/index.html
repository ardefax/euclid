    <p>For, if possible, let the medial area AB exceed the medial area AC by the rational area DB,  and let a rational straight line EF be set out; to EF let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram FH equal to AB, producing EH as breadth, and let the rectangle FG equal to AC be subtracted; therefore the remainder BD is equal to the remainder KH. </p>
  
    <p>But DB is rational; therefore KH is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, each of the rectangles AB, AC is medial, and AB is equal to FH, and AC to FG, therefore each of the rectangles FH, FG is also medial. </p>
  
    <p>And they are applied to the rational straight line EF; therefore each of the straight lines HE, EG is rational and incommensurable in length with EF. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.22">X. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since [DB is rational and is equal to KH, therefore] KH is [also] rational; and it is applied to the rational straight line EF; therefore GH is rational and commensurable in length with EF. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.20">X. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But EG is also rational, and is incommensurable in length with EF; therefore EG is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, as EG is to GH, so is the square on EG to the rectangle EG, GH; therefore the square on EG is incommensurable with the rectangle EG, GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the squares on EG, GH are commensurable with the square on EG, for both are rational; and twice the rectangle EG, GH is commensurable with the rectangle EG, GH, for it is double of it; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] therefore the squares on EG, GH are incommensurable with twice the rectangle EG, GH; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] therefore also the sum of the squares on EG, GH and twice the rectangle EG, GH, that is, the square on EH [<a href="/books/2/#prop.4">II. 4</a>], is incommensurable with the squares on EG, GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.16">X. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the squares on EG, GH are rational; therefore the square on EH is irrational. [<a href="/books/10/#def.4">X. Def. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore EH is irrational. </p>
  
    <p>But it is also rational: which is impossible. </p>
