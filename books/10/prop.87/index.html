  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let a rational straight line A be set out, let three numbers E, BC, CD be set out which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but let CB have to BD the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let it be contrived that, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the square on FG, and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square on GH. [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Since then, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the square on FG, therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square on FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the square on A is rational; therefore the square on FG is also rational; therefore FG is rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since E has not to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on A to the square on FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore A is incommensurable in length with FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square on GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the square on FG is rational; therefore the square on GH is also rational; therefore GH is rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since BC has not to CD the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on FG to the square on GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And both are rational; therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore FH is an apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a third apotome. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as E is to BC, so is the square on A to the square on FG, and, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square on HG, therefore, ex aequali, as E is to CD, so is the square on A to the square on HG. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But E has not to CD the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on A to the square on GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore A is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore neither of the straight lines FG, GH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line A set out. </p>
  
    <p>Now let the square on K be that by which the square on FG is greater than the square on GH. </p>
  
    <p>Since then, as BC is to CD, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as BC is to BD, so is the square on FG to the square on K. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But BC has to BD the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on FG also has to the square on K the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore FG is commensurable in length with K, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] and the square on FG is greater than the square on GH by the square on a straight line commensurable with FG. </p>
  
    <p>And neither of the straight lines FG, GH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line A set out; therefore FH is a third apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.3">X. Deff. III. 3</a>] </p>
