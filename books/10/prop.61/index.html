    <p>Let AB be a first bimedial straight line divided into its medials at C, of which medials AC is the greater; let a rational straight line DE be set out, and let there be applied to DE the parallelogram DF equal to the square on AB, producing DG as its breadth; I say that DG is a second binominal straight line. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For let the same construction as before be made. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since AB is a first bimedial divided at C, therefore AC, CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, and containing a rational rectangle, [<a href="/books/10/#prop.37">X. 37</a>] so that the squares on AC, CB are also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore DL is medial. [<a href="#elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1">X. 15 and 23, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And it has been applied to the rational straight line DE; therefore MD is rational and incommensurable in length with DE. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.22">X. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since twice the rectangle AC, CB is rational, MF is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>And it is applied to the rational straight line ML; therefore MG is also rational and commensurable in length with ML, that is, DE; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.20">X. 20</a>] therefore DM is incommensurable in length with MG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And they are rational; therefore DM, MG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore DG is binomial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.36">X. 36</a>] </p>
  
    <p>It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial straight line. </p>
  
    <p>For, since the squares on AC, CB are greater than twice the rectangle AC, CB, therefore DL is also greater than MF, so that DM is also greater than MG. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the square on AC is commensurable with the square on CB, DH is also commensurable with KL, so that DK is also commensurable with KM. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the rectangle DK, KM is equal to the square on MN; therefore the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with DM. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.17">X. 17</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And MG is commensurable is length with DE. </p>
