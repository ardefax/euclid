  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that the sum of them AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let any other number D, not square, be set out also, and let it not have to either of the numbers BA. AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Let any rational straight line E be set out, and let it be contrived that, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the square on FG; [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on E is commensurable with the square on FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And E is rational; therefore FG is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since D has not to AB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on E to the square on FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore E is incommensurable in length with FG. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Next let it be contrived that, as the number BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH; [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square on GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But FG is rational; therefore GH is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since BA has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on FG to the square on HG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore FG is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore FH is binomial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.36">X. 36</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a third binomial straight line. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the square on FG, and, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as D is to AC, so is the square on E to the square on GH. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But D has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on E to the square on GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore E is incommensurable in length with GH. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And since, as BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH, therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH. </p>
  
    <p>Let then the squares on GH, K be equal to the square on FG; therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, as AB is to BC, so is the square on FG to the square on K. [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on FG also has to the square on K the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore FG is commensurable in length with K. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the square on FG is greater than the square on GH by the square on a straight line commensurable with FG. </p>
  
    <p>And FG, GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with E. </p>
