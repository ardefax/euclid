    <p>For let the area ABCD be contained by the rational straight line AB and the sixth binomial AD, divided into its terms at E, so that AE is the greater term; I say that the <quote>side</quote>
 of AC is the side of the sum of two medial areas. </p>
  
    <p>Let the same construction be made as before shown. 
      </p>
  
    <p>It is then manifest that MO is the <quote>side</quote>
 of AC, and that MN is incommensurable in square with NO.
      </p>
  
    <p>Now, since EA is incommensurable in length with AB, therefore EA, AB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore AK, that is, the sum of the squares on MN, NO, is medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Again, since ED is incommensurable in length with AB, therefore FE is also incommensurable with EK; [<a href="/books/10/#prop.13">X. 13</a>] therefore FE, EK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore EL, that is, MR, that is, the rectangle MN, NO, is medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.21">X. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since AE is incommensurable with EF, AK is also incommensurable with EL. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.1">VI. 1</a>, <a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AK is the sum of the squares on MN, NO, and EL is the rectangle MN, NO; therefore the sum of the squares on MN, NO is incommensurable with the rectangle MN, NO.
      </p>
  
    <p>And each of them is medial, and MN, NO are incommensurable in square. </p>

    <p>Therefore MO is the side of the sum of two medial areas [<a href="/books/10/#prop.41">X. 41</a>], and is the <quote>side</quote>
 of AC. Q. E. D.
