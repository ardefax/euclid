    <p>Let a rational straight line A be set out, and let BG be commensurable in length with A; therefore BG is also rational. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let two square numbers DE, EF be set out, and let their difference FD not be square; therefore neither has ED to DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
  
    <p>Let it be contrived that, as ED is to DF, so is the square on BG to the square on GC; [<a href="/books/10/#6.p.1">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on BG is commensurable with the square on GC. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the square on BG is rational; therefore the square on GC is also rational; therefore GC is also rational. </p>
  
    <p>And, since ED has not to DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on GC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is incommensurable in length with GC. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And both are rational; therefore BG, GC are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore BC is an apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
  
    <p>I say next that it is also a first apotome. </p>
  
    <p>For let the square on H be that by which the square on BG is greater than the square on GC. </p>
  
    <p>Now since. as ED is to FD, so is the square on BG to the square on GC, therefore also, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, [<a href="/books/5/#19.p.1">v. 19, Por.</a>] as DE is to EF, so is the square on GB to the square on H. </p>
  
    <p>But DE has to EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, for each is square; therefore the square on GB also has to the square on H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is commensurable in length with H. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And the square on BG is greater than the square on GC by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with BG. </p>
  
    <p>And the whole BG is commensurable in length with the rational straight line A set out. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore BC is a first apotome. [<a href="/books/10/#def.3.1">X. Deff. III. 1</a>] </p>
