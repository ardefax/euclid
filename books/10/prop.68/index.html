    <p>Let AB be major, and let CD be commensurable with AB; I say that CD is major. </p>
  
    <p>Let AB be divided at E; therefore AE, EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.39">X. 39</a>] 
      </p>
  
    <p>Let the same construction be made as before. </p>
  
    <p>Then since, as AB is to CD, so is AE to CF, and EB to FD, therefore also, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But AB is commensurable with CD; therefore AE, EB are also commensurable with CF, FD respectively. [<a href="/books/10/#prop.11">X. 11</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And since, as AE is to CF, so is EB to FD, alternately also, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] therefore also, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>, as AB is to BE, so is CD to DF; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.18">V. 18</a>] therefore also, as the square on AB is to the square on BE, so is the square on CD to the square on DF. [<a href="/books/6/#prop.20">VI. 20</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Similarly we can prove that, as the square on AB is to the square on AE, so also is the square on CD to the square on CF. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore also, as the square on AB is to the squares on AE, EB, so is the square on CD to the squares on CF, FD; therefore also, alternately, as the square on AB is to the square on CD, so are the squares on AE, EB to the squares on CF, FD. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But the square on AB is commensurable with the square on CD; therefore the squares on AE, EB are also commensurable with the squares on CF, FD. </p>
  
    <p>And the squares on AE, EB together are rational; therefore the squares on CF, FD together are rational. </p>
  
    <p>Similarly also twice the rectangle AE, EB is commensurable with twice the rectangle CF, FD. </p>
  
    <p>And twice the rectangle AE, EB is medial; therefore twice the rectangle CF, FD is also medial. [<a href="/books/10/#23.p.1">X. 23, Por.</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Therefore CF, FD are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole CD is the irrational straight line called major.
