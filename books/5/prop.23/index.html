  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let there be three magnitudes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, and others equal to them in multitude, which, taken two and two together, are in the same proportion, namely <var>D</var>, <var>E</var>, <var>F</var>; and let the proportion of them be perturbed, so that, as <var>A</var> is to <var>B</var>, so is <var>E</var> to <var>F</var>, and, as <var>B</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>D</var> to <var>E</var>; I say that, as <var>A</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>D</var> to <var>F</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>Of <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>D</var> let equimultiples <var>G</var>, <var>H</var>, <var>K</var> be taken, and of <var>C</var>, <var>E</var>, <var>F</var> other, chance, equimultiples <var>L</var>, <var>M</var>, <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>G</var>, <var>H</var> are equimultiples of <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [<a href="/books/5/#prop.15">V. 15</a>] therefore, as <var>A</var> is to <var>B</var>, so is <var>G</var> to <var>H</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as <var>E</var> is to <var>F</var>, so is <var>M</var> to <var>N</var>. And, as <var>A</var> is to <var>B</var>, so is <var>E</var> to <var>F</var>; therefore also, as <var>G</var> is to <var>H</var>, so is <var>M</var> to <var>N</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Next, since, as <var>B</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>D</var> to <var>E</var>, alternately, also, as <var>B</var> is to <var>D</var>, so is <var>C</var> to <var>E</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>H</var>, <var>K</var> are equimultiples of <var>B</var>, <var>D</var>, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples, therefore, as <var>B</var> is to <var>D</var>, so is <var>H</var> to <var>K</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.15">V. 15</a>]
       </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>B</var> is to <var>D</var>, so is <var>C</var> to <var>E</var>; therefore also, as <var>H</var> is to <var>K</var>, so is <var>C</var> to <var>E</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>L</var>, <var>M</var> are equimultiples of <var>C</var>, <var>E</var>, therefore, as <var>C</var> is to <var>E</var>, so is <var>L</var> to <var>M</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.15">V. 15</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>But, as <var>C</var> is to <var>E</var>, so is <var>H</var> to <var>K</var>; therefore also, as <var>H</var> is to <var>K</var>, so is <var>L</var> to <var>M</var>, [<a href="/books/5/#prop.11">V. 11</a>] and, alternately, as <var>H</var> is to <var>L</var>, so is <var>K</var> to <var>M</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.16">V. 16</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But it was also proved that, as <var>G</var> is to <var>H</var>, so is <var>M</var> to <var>N</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, there are three magnitudes <var>G</var>, <var>H</var>, <var>L</var>, and others equal to them in multitude <var>K</var>, <var>M</var>, <var>N</var>, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them is perturbed, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, if <var>G</var> is in excess of <var>L</var>, <var>K</var> is also in excess of <var>N</var>; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.21">V. 21</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And <var>G</var>, <var>K</var> are equimultiples of <var>A</var>, <var>D</var>, and <var>L</var>, <var>N</var> of <var>C</var>, <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, as <var>A</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>D</var> to <var>F</var>. </p>
