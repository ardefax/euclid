    <p>For let a first magnitude <var>A</var> have to a second <var>B</var> the same ratio as a third <var>C</var> has to a fourth <var>D</var>, and let the third <var>C</var> have to the fourth <var>D</var> a greater ratio than a fifth <var>E</var> has to a sixth <var>F</var>; I say that the first <var>A</var> will also have to the second <var>B</var> a greater ratio than the fifth <var>E</var> to the sixth <var>F</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, since there are some equimultiples of <var>C</var>, <var>E</var>, and of <var>D</var>, <var>F</var> other, chance, equimultiples, such that the multiple of <var>C</var> is in excess of the multiple of <var>D</var>, while the multiple of <var>E</var> is not in excess of the multiple of <var>F</var>, [<a href="/books/5/#def.7">V. Def. 7</a>] let them be taken, and let <var>G</var>, <var>H</var> be equimultiples of <var>C</var>, <var>E</var>, and <var>K</var>, <var>L</var> other, chance, equimultiples of <var>D</var>, <var>F</var>, so that <var>G</var> is in excess of <var>K</var>, but <var>H</var> is not in excess of <var>L</var>; and, whatever multiple <var>G</var> is of <var>C</var>, let <var>M</var> be also that multiple of <var>A</var>, and, whatever multiple <var>K</var> is of <var>D</var>, let <var>N</var> be also that multiple of <var>B</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Now, since, as <var>A</var> is to <var>B</var>, so is <var>C</var> to <var>D</var>, and of <var>A</var>, <var>C</var> equimultiples <var>M</var>, <var>G</var> have been taken, and of <var>B</var>, <var>D</var> other, chance, equimultiples <var>N</var>, <var>K</var>, therefore, if <var>M</var> is in excess of <var>N</var>, <var>G</var> is also in excess of <var>K</var>, if equal, equal, and if less, less. [<a href="/books/5/#def.5">V. Def. 5</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But <var>G</var> is in excess of <var>K</var>; therefore <var>M</var> is also in excess of <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>H</var> is not in excess of <var>L</var>; and <var>M</var>, <var>H</var> are equimultiples of <var>A</var>, <var>E</var>, and <var>N</var>, <var>L</var> other, chance, equimultiples of <var>B</var>, <var>F</var>; therefore <var>A</var> has to <var>B</var> a greater ratio than <var>E</var> has to <var>F</var>.
