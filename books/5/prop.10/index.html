    <p>For let <var>A</var> have to <var>C</var> a greater ratio than <var>B</var> has to <var>C</var>; I say that <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, <var>A</var> is either equal to <var>B</var> or less. </p>
  
    <p>Now <var>A</var> is not equal to <var>B</var>; for in that case each of the magnitudes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> would have had the same ratio to <var>C</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.7">V. 7</a>] but they have not; therefore <var>A</var> is not equal to <var>B</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Nor again is <var>A</var> less than <var>B</var>; for in that case <var>A</var> would have had to <var>C</var> a less ratio than <var>B</var> has to <var>C</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.8">V. 8</a>] but it has not; therefore <var>A</var> is not less than <var>B</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>But it was proved not to be equal either; therefore <var>A</var> is greater than <var>B</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, let <var>C</var> have to <var>B</var> a greater ratio than <var>C</var> has to <var>A</var>; I say that <var>B</var> is less than <var>A</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, if not, it is either equal or greater. </p>
  
    <p>Now <var>B</var> is not equal to <var>A</var>; for in that case <var>C</var> would have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.7">V. 7</a>] but it has not; therefore <var>A</var> is not equal to <var>B</var>.
