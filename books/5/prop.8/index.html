  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>AB</var>, <var>C</var> be unequal magnitudes, and let <var>AB</var> be greater; let <var>D</var> be another, chance, magnitude; I say that <var>AB</var> has to <var>D</var> a greater ratio than <var>C</var> has to <var>D</var>, and <var>D</var> has to <var>C</var> a greater ratio than it has to <var>AB</var>. 
      </p>
  
    <p>For, since <var>AB</var> is greater than <var>C</var>, let <var>BE</var> be made equal to <var>C</var>; then the less of the magnitudes <var>AE</var>, <var>EB</var>, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than <var>D</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#def.4">V. Def. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>[<title>Case</title> I.] </p>
  
    <p>First, let <var>AE</var> be less than <var>EB</var>; let <var>AE</var> be multiplied, and let <var>FG</var> be a multiple of it which is greater than <var>D</var>; then, whatever multiple <var>FG</var> is of <var>AE</var>, let <var>GH</var> be made the same multiple of <var>EB</var> and <var>K</var> of <var>C</var>; and let <var>L</var> be taken double of <var>D</var>, <var>M</var> triple of it, and successive multiples increasing by one, until what is taken is a multiple of <var>D</var> and the first that is greater than <var>K</var>. Let it be taken, and let it be <var>N</var> which is quadruple of <var>D</var> and the first multiple of it that is greather than <var>K</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>K</var> is less than <var>N</var> first, therefore <var>K</var> is not less than <var>M</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And, since <var>FG</var> is the same multiple of <var>AE</var> that <var>GH</var> is of <var>EB</var>, therefore <var>FG</var> is the same multiple of <var>AE</var> that <var>FH</var> is of <var>AB</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.1">V. 1</a>] </p>
  
    <p>But <var>FG</var> is the same multiple of <var>AE</var> that <var>K</var> is of <var>C</var>; therefore <var>FH</var> is the same multiple of <var>AB</var> that <var>K</var> is of <var>C</var>; therefore <var>FH</var>, <var>K</var> are equimultiples of <var>AB</var>, <var>C</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>Again, since <var>GH</var> is the same multiple of <var>EB</var> that <var>K</var> is of <var>C</var>, and <var>EB</var> is equal to <var>C</var>, therefore <var>GH</var> is equal to <var>K</var>.
       </p>
  
    <p>But <var>K</var> is not less than <var>M</var>; therefore neither is <var>GH</var> less than <var>M</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>And <var>FG</var> is greater than <var>D</var>; therefore the whole <var>FH</var> is greater than <var>D</var>, <var>M</var> together. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>D</var>, <var>M</var> together are equal to <var>N</var>, inasmuch as <var>M</var> is triple of <var>D</var>, and <var>M</var>, <var>D</var> together are quadruple of <var>D</var>, while <var>N</var> is also quadruple of <var>D</var>; whence <var>M</var>, <var>D</var> together are equal to <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>FH</var> is greater than <var>M</var>, <var>D</var>; therefore <var>FH</var> is in excess of <var>N</var>, while <var>K</var> is not in excess of <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And <var>FH</var>, <var>K</var> are equimultiples of <var>AB</var>, <var>C</var>, while <var>N</var> is another, chance, multiple of <var>D</var>; therefore <var>AB</var> has to <var>D</var> a greater ratio than <var>C</var> has to <var>D</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#def.7">V. Def. 7</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>I say next, that <var>D</var> also has to <var>C</var> a greater ratio than <var>D</var> has to <var>AB</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <var>N</var> is in excess of <var>K</var>, while <var>N</var> is not in excess of <var>FH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And <var>N</var> is a multiple of <var>D</var>, while <var>FH</var>, <var>K</var> are other, chance, equimultiples of <var>AB</var>, <var>C</var>; therefore <var>D</var> has to <var>C</var> a greater ratio than <var>D</var> has to <var>AB</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#def.7">V. Def. 7</a>]
      </p>
  
    <p>[<title>Case</title> 2.] </p>
  
    <p>Again, let <var>AE</var> be greater than <var>EB</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then the less, <var>EB</var>, if multiplied, will sometime be greater than <var>D</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#def.4">V. Def. 4</a>] </p>
  
    <p>Let it be multiplied, and let <var>GH</var> be a multiple of <var>EB</var> and greater than <var>D</var>; and, whatever multiple <var>GH</var> is of <var>EB</var>, let <var>FG</var> be made the same multiple of <var>AE</var>, and <var>K</var>
        of <var>C</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Then we can prove similarly that <var>FH</var>, <var>K</var> are equimultiples of <var>AB</var>, <var>C</var>; and, similarly, let <var>N</var> be taken a multiple of <var>D</var> but the first that is greater than <var>FG</var>, so that <var>FG</var> is again not less than <var>M</var>. </p>
  
    <p>But <var>GH</var> is greater than <var>D</var>; therefore the whole <var>FH</var> is in excess of <var>D</var>, <var>M</var>, that is, of <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Now <var>K</var> is not in excess of <var>N</var>, inasmuch as <var>FG</var> also, which is greater than <var>GH</var>, that is, than <var>K</var>, is not in excess of <var>N</var>. </p>
  
    <p>And in the same manner, by following the above argument, we complete the demonstration. </p>
