    <p>Let a first magnitude <var>AB</var> have to a second <var>C</var> the same ratio as a third <var>DE</var> has to a fourth <var>F</var>; and let also a fifth <var>BG</var> have to  the second <var>C</var> the same ratio as a sixth <var>EH</var> has to the fourth <var>F</var>; I say that the first and fifth added together, <var>AG</var>, will have to the second <var>C</var> the same ratio as the third and sixth, <var>DH</var>, has to the fourth <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For since, as <var>BG</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>EH</var> to <var>F</var>, inversely, as <var>C</var> is to <var>BG</var>, so is <var>F</var> to <var>EH</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Since, then, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>F</var>, and, as <var>C</var> is to <var>BG</var>, so is <var>F</var> to <var>EH</var>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BG</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>EH</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
  
    <p>And, since the magnitudes are proportional <foreign lang="la">separando</foreign>, they will also be proportional <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign>; [<a href="/books/5/#prop.18">V. 18</a>] therefore, as <var>AG</var> is to <var>GB</var>, so is <var>DH</var> to <var>HE</var>.
      </p>
  
    <p>But also, as <var>BG</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>EH</var> to <var>F</var>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <var>AG</var> is to <var>C</var>, so is <var>DH</var> to <var>F</var>. [<a href="/books/5/#prop.22">V. 22</a>] </p>
