    <p>Let a first magnitude, <var>AB</var>, be the same multiple of a second, <var>C</var>, that a third, <var>DE</var>, is of a fourth, <var>F</var>, and let a fifth, <var>BG</var>, also be the same multiple of the second, <var>C</var>, that a sixth, <var>EH</var>, is of the fourth <var>F</var>;  I say that the sum of the first and fifth, <var>AG</var>, will be the same multiple of the second, <var>C</var>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <var>DH</var>, is of the fourth, <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, since <var>AB</var> is the same multiple of <var>C</var> that <var>DE</var> is of <var>F</var>, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in <var>AB</var> equal to <var>C</var>, so many also are there in <var>DE</var> equal to <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For the same reason also, as many as there are in <var>BG</var> equal to <var>C</var>, so many are there also in <var>EH</var> equal to <var>F</var>; therefore, as many as there are in the whole <var>AG</var> equal to <var>C</var>, so many also are there in the whole <var>DH</var> equal to <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore, whatever multiple <var>AG</var> is of <var>C</var>, that multiple also is <var>DH</var> of <var>F</var>. </p>
  
    <p>Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, <var>AG</var>, is the same multiple of the second, <var>C</var>, that the sum of the third and sixth, <var>DH</var>, is of the fourth, <var>F</var>. </p>
