  <section id="" class="proof">
  
  
  
    <p>Let <var>ABC</var>, <var>DEF</var> be two triangles having the two angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>BCA</var> equal to the two angles <var>DEF</var>, <var>EFD</var> respectively, namely the angle <var>ABC</var> to the angle <var>DEF</var>, and the angle <var>BCA</var> to the angle <var>EFD</var>; and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely <var>BC</var> to <var>EF</var>;</p>
  
    <p>I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, namely <var>AB</var> to <var>DE</var> and <var>AC</var> to <var>DF</var>, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, namely the angle <var>BAC</var> to the angle <var>EDF</var>. </p>
  
    <p>For, if <var>AB</var> is unequal to <var>DE</var>, one of them is greater.</p>
  
    <p>Let <var>AB</var> be greater, and let <var>BG</var> be made equal to <var>DE</var>; and let <var>GC</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>BG</var> is equal to <var>DE</var>, and <var>BC</var> to <var>EF</var>, the two sides <var>GB</var>, <var>BC</var> are equal to the two sides <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var> respectively; and the angle <var>GBC</var> is equal to the angle <var>DEF</var>; therefore the base <var>GC</var> is equal to the base <var>DF</var>, <lb n="25"/>and the triangle <var>GBC</var> is equal to the triangle <var>DEF</var>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <var>GCB</var> is equal to the angle <var>DFE</var>. But the angle <var>DFE</var> is by hypothesis equal to the angle <var>BCA</var>; therefore the angle <var>BCG</var> is equal to the angle <var>BCA</var>, the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore <var>AB</var> is not unequal to <var>DE</var>, and is therefore equal to it.</p>
  
    <p>But <var>BC</var> is also equal to <var>EF</var>; therefore the two sides <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var> are equal to the two sides <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var> respectively, and the angle <var>ABC</var> is equal to the angle <var>DEF</var>; therefore the base <var>AC</var> is equal to the base <var>DF</var>, and the remaining angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the remaining <lb n="40"/>angle <var>EDF</var>. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>]
        </p>
  
    <p>Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as <var>AB</var> to <var>DE</var>;</p>
  
    <p>I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides, namely <var>AC</var> to <var>DF</var> and <var>BC</var> to <var>EF</var>, and further the remaining angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the remaining angle <var>EDF</var>.</p>
  
    <p>For, if <var>BC</var> is unequal to <var>EF</var>, one of them is greater.</p>
  
    <p>Let <var>BC</var> be greater, if possible, and let <var>BH</var> be made equal to <var>EF</var>; let <var>AH</var> be joined. </p>
  
    <p>Then, since <var>BH</var> is equal to <var>EF</var>, and <var>AB</var> to <var>DE</var>, the two sides <var>AB</var>, <var>BH</var> are equal to the two sides <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var> respectively, and they contain equal angles; therefore the base <var>AH</var> is equal to the base <var>DF</var>, and the triangle <var>ABH</var> is equal to the triangle <var>DEF</var>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [<a href="/books/1/#prop.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the angle <var>BHA</var> is equal to the angle <var>EFD</var>.</p>
  
    <p>But the angle <var>EFD</var> is equal to the angle <var>BCA</var>; therefore, in the triangle <var>AHC</var>, the exterior angle <var>BHA</var> is equal to the interior and opposite angle <var>BCA</var>: which is impossible. [<a href="/books/1/#prop.16">I. 16</a>]</p>
  
    <p>Therefore <var>BC</var> is not unequal to <var>EF</var>, and is therefore equal to it.</p>
  
    <p>But <var>AB</var> is also equal to <var>DE</var>; therefore the two sides <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var> are equal to the two sides <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var> respectively, and they contain equal angles; therefore the base <var>AC</var> is equal to the base <var>DF</var>, the triangle <var>ABC</var> equal to the triangle <var>DEF</var>, and the remaining angle <var>BAC</var> equal to the remaining angle <var>EDF</var>.
