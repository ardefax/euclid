        "I say that no other straight line can be annexed to AB which fulfils the aforesaid conditions. ",

[<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.78\">X. 78</a>] ",
        "Let a rational straight line EF be set out, let EG equal to the squares on AC, CB be applied to EF, producing EM as breadth, and let HG equal to twice the rectangle AC, CB be applied to EF, producing HM as breadth; therefore the remainder, the square on AB [<a href=\"/books/2/#prop.7\">II. 7</a>], is equal to EL; therefore AB is the <quote>side</quote>\n of EL.
