        "For let the area AC be contained by the rational straight line AB and the fifth binomial AD divided into its terms at E, so that AE is the greater term; I say that the <quote>side</quote>\n of the area AC is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area. ",

        "Therefore AK, that is, the sum of the squares on MN, NO, is medial. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.21\">X. 21</a>] ",
        "And, since DE is commensurable in length with AB, that is, with EK, while DE is commensurable with EF, therefore EF is also commensurable with EK. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.12\">X. 12</a>] ",
        "And EK is rational; therefore EL, that is, MR, that is, the rectangle MN, NO, is also rational. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.19\">X. 19</a>] ",
        "Therefore MN, NO are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. "
