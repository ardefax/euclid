        "For let two straight lines AB, BC incommensurable in square and satisfying the given conditions [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.35\">X. 35</a>\n] be added together; I say that AC is irrational. \n      ",
        "Let a rational straight line DE be set out, and let there be applied to DE the rectangle DF equal to the squares on AB, BC, and the rectangle GH equal to twice the rectangle AB, BC; therefore the whole DH is equal to the square on AC. [<a href=\"/books/2/#prop.4\">II. 4</a>\n] ",
