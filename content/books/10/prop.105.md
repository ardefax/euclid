        "Now since, as AE is to EB, so is CF to FD, [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.12\">V. 12</a>, <a href=\"/books/5/#prop.16\">V. 16</a>] therefore also, as the square on AE is to the square on EB, so is the square on CF to the square on FD. [<a href=\"/books/6/#prop.22\">VI. 22</a>] ",

        "Again, since, as the square on AE is to the rectangle AE, EB, so is the square on CF to the rectangle CF, FD, while the square on AE is commensurable with the square on CF, therefore the rectangle AE, EB is also commensurable with the rectangle CF, FD. ",
        "But the rectangle AE, EB is medial; [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.76\">X. 76</a>] therefore the rectangle CF, FD is also medial; [<a href=\"/books/10/#23.p.1\">X. 23, Por.</a>] therefore CF, FD are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial.
