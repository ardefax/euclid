        "Let two numbers AC, CB be set out such that the sum of them AB has to BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number. \n      ",

        "Let any rational straight line E be set out, and let it be contrived that, as D is to AB, so is the square on E to the square on FG; [<a href=\"/books/10/#6.p.1\">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on E is commensurable with the square on FG. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.6\">X. 6</a>] ",
        "And E is rational; therefore FG is also rational. ",
        "And, since D has not to AB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on E to the square on FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore E is incommensurable in length with FG. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.9\">X. 9</a>] ",
        "Next let it be contrived that, as the number BA is to AC, so is the square on FG to the square on GH; [<a href=\"/books/10/#6.p.1\">X. 6, Por.</a>] therefore the square on FG is commensurable with the square on GH. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.6\">X. 6</a>] ",
