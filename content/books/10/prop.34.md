        "Let there be set out two medial straight lines AB, BC, commensurable in square only, such that the rectangle which they contain is rational, and the square on AB is greater than the square on BC by the square on a straight line incommensurable with AB; [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.31\">X. 31</a>, ad fin.]  let the semicircle ADB be described on AB, let BC be bisected at E, let there be applied to AB a parallelogram equal to the square on BE and deficient by a square figure, namely the rectangle AF, FB; [<a href=\"/books/6/#prop.28\">VI. 28</a>] therefore AF is incommensurable in length with FB.
