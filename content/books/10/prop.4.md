        "Let A, B, C be the three given commensurable magnitudes; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of A, B, C. \n      ",
        "Let the greatest common measure of the two magnitudes A, B be taken, and let it be D; [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.3\">X. 3</a>] then D either measures C, or does not measure it. ",
        "First, let it measure it. ",
        "Since then D measures C, while it also measures A, B, therefore D is a common measure of A, B, C. ",
        "And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude D does not measure A, B. ",
        "Next, let D not measure C. ",
        "I say first that C, D are commensurable. ",
        "For, since A, B, C are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them, and this will of course measure A, B also; so that it will also measure the greatest common measure of A, B, namely D. [<a href=\"/books/10/#3.p.1\">X. 3, Por.</a>] ",
        "But it also measures C; so that the said magnitude will measure C, D; therefore C, D are commensurable. ",
        "Now let their greatest common measure be taken, and let it be E. [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.3\">X. 3</a>] ",
        "Since then E measures D, while D measures A, B, therefore E will also measure A, B. ",
        "But it measures C also; therefore E measures A, B, C; therefore E is a common measure of A, B, C. ",
        "I say next that it is also the greatest. ",
        "For, if possible, let there be some magnitude F greater than E, and let it measure A, B, C. ",
        "Now, since F measures A, B, C, it will also measure A, B, and will measure the greatest common measure of A, B. [<a href=\"/books/10/#3.p.1\">X. 3, Por.</a>] ",
        "But the greatest common measure of A, B is D; therefore F measures D. ",
        "But it measures C also; therefore F measures C, D; therefore F will also measure the greatest common measure of C, D. [<a href=\"/books/10/#3.p.1\">X. 3, Por.</a>] ",
        "But that is E; therefore F will measure E, the greater the less: which is impossible. ",
        "Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude E will measure A, B, C; therefore E is the greatest common measure of A, B, C if D do not measure C, and, if it measure it, D is itself the greatest common measure. "
