        "Therefore the square on GB is also rational; [<a href=\"/books/10/#prop.6\">X. 6</a>] therefore BG is also rational. ",
        "Now since, as DE is to EF, so is the square on BG to the square on GC, while DE has not to EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on BG to the square on GC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BG is incommensurable in length with GC.
