        "For let an area, the rectangle AB, CD, be contained by the apotome AB and the binomial straight line CD, and let CE be the greater term of the latter; let the terms CE, ED of the binomial straight line be commensurable with the terms AF, FB of the apotome and in the same ratio; and let the <quote>side</quote>\n of the rectangle AB, CD be G; I say that G is rational. \n      ",
        "For let a rational straight line H be set out, and to CD let there be applied a rectangle equal to the square on H and producing KL as breadth. ",
