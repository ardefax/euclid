        "For let the two magnitudes A, B have to one another the ratio which the number D has to the number E; I say that the magnitudes A, B are commensurable. \n      ",
        "For let A be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in D, and let C be equal to one of them; and let F be made up of as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in E. ",
        "Since then there are in A as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in D, whatever part the unit is of D, the same part is C of A also; therefore, as C is to A, so is the unit to D. [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.20\">VII. Def. 20</a>] ",
        "But the unit measures the number D; therefore C also measures A. ",
        "And since, as C is to A, so is the unit to D, therefore, inversely, as A is to C, so is the number D to the unit. [cf. <a href=\"/books/5/#7.p.1\">V. 7, Por.</a>] ",
        "Again, since there are in F as many magnitudes equal to C as there are units in E, therefore, as C is to F, so is the unit to E. [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.20\">VII. Def. 20</a>] ",
        "But it was also proved that, as <hi rend=\"ital\">A</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">C</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi> to the unit;\n       therefore, <foreign lang=\"la\">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to F, so is D to E. [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.22\">v. 22</a>] ",
        "But, as D is to E, so is A to B; therefore also, as A is to B, so is it to F also. [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.11\">V. 11</a>] ",
        "Therefore A has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes B, F; therefore B is equal to F. [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.9\">V. 9</a>] ",
        "But C measures F; therefore it measures B also. ",
        "Further it measures A also; therefore C measures A, B. ",
        "Therefore A is commensurable with B. "
