        "Let A, B be the two given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure. ",
        "Now A, B are either prime to one another or not. \n      ",
        "First, let A, B be prime to one another, and let A by multiplying B make C; therefore also B by multiplying A has made C. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.16\">VII. 16</a>] ",
        "Therefore A, B measure C\n      ",
        "I say next that it is also the least number they measure. ",
        "For, if not, A, B will measure some number which is less than C. ",
        "Let them measure D. ",
        "Then, as many times as A measures D, so many units let there be in E, and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there be in F; therefore A by multiplying E has made D, and B by multiplying F has made D; [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.15\">VII. Def. 15</a>] therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F. ",
        "Therefore, as A is to B, so is F\n       E. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But A, B are prime, primes are also least, [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.21\">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] therefore B measures E, as consequent consequent. ",
        "And, since A by multiplying B, E has made C, D, therefore, as B is to E, so is C to D. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But B measures E; therefore C also measures D, the greater the less: which is impossible. ",
        "Therefore A, B do not measure any number less than C; therefore C is the least that is measured by A, B. ",
        "Next, let A, B not be prime to one another, and let F, E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A, B, be taken; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.33\">VII. 33</a>] therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, F. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "And let A by multiplying E make C; therefore also B by multiplying F has made C; therefore A, B measure C. \n      ",

        "Let them measure D. ",
        "And, as many times as A measures D, so many units let there be in G, and, as many times as B measures D, so many units let there be in H. ",
        "Therefore A by multiplying G has made D, and B by multiplying H has made D. ",
        "Therefore the product of A, G is equal to the product of B, H; therefore, as A is to B, so is H to G. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But, as A is to B, so is F to E. ",
        "Therefore also, as F is to E, so is H to G. ",
        "But F, E are least, and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures G. ",
