        "Let DE be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to BD, let DE be made equal to AB, and let BE, AE, AD be joined. ",
        "Now, since AB is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore AB is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [<a href=\"/books/11/#def.3\">XI. Def. 3</a>] therefore each of the angles ABD, ABE is right. ",
        "And, since the straight line BD has fallen on the parallels AB, CD, therefore the angles ABD, CDB are equal to two right angles. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.29\">I. 29</a>] ",

        "And, since AB is equal to DE, and BD is common, the two sides AB, BD are equal to the two sides ED, DB; and the angle ABD is equal to the angle EDB, for each is right; therefore the base AD is equal to the base BE. ",
        "And, since AB is equal to DE, and BE to AD, the two sides AB, BE are equal to the two sides ED, DA respectively, and AE is their common base; therefore the angle ABE is equal to the angle EDA. ",
        "But the angle ABE is right; therefore the angle EDA is also right; therefore ED is at right angles to AD. ",
        "But it is also at right angles to DB; therefore ED is also at right angles to the plane through BD, DA. [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.4\">XI. 4</a>] ",
        "Therefore ED will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through BD, DA. ",
        "But DC is in the plane through BD, DA, inasmuch as AB, BD are in the plane through BD, DA, [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.2\">XI. 2</a>] and DC is also in the plane in which AB, BD are. ",
