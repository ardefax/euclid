        "For let BG be drawn from the point B perpendicular to the plane through DE, EF [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.11\">XI. 11</a>], and let it meet the plane at the point G; through G let GH be drawn parallel to ED, and GK parallel to EF. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.31\">I. 31</a>] ",
        "Now, since BG is at right angles to the plane through DE, EF, therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through DE, EF. [<a href=\"/books/11/#def.3\">XI. Def. 3</a>] ",
        "But each of the straight lines GH, GK meets it and is in the plane through DE, EF; therefore each of the angles BGH, BGK is right. ",

        "But planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel; [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.14\">XI. 14</a>] therefore the plane through AB, BC is parallel to the plane through DE, EF. "
