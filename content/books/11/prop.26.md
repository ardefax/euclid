        "For let a point F be taken at random on DF, let FG be drawn from F perpendicular to the plane through ED, DC, and let it meet the plane at G, [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.11\">XI. 11</a>] let DG be joined, let there be constructed on the straight line AB and at the point A on it the angle BAL equal to the angle EDC, and the angle BAK equal to the angle EDG, [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.23\">I. 23</a>] let AK be made equal to DG, let KH be set up from the point K at right angles to the plane through BA, AL, [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.12\">XI. 12</a>] let KH be made equal to GF, and let HA be joined; I say that the solid angle at A, contained by the angles BAL, BAH, HAL is equal to the solid angle at D contained by the angles EDC, EDF, FDC.
