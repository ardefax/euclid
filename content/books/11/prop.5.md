        "For let a straight line AB be set up at right angles to the three straight lines BC, BD, BE, at their point of meeting at B; I say that BC, BD, BE are in one plane. \n      ",
        "For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let BD, BE be in the plane of reference and BC in one more elevated; let the plane through AB, BC be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [<a href=\"/books/11/#prop.3\">XI. 3</a>] ",
        "Let it make BF. ",
        "Therefore the three straight lines AB, BC, BF are in one plane, namely that drawn through AB, BC. ",

        "But the plane through BD, BE is the plane of reference; therefore AB is at right angles to the plane of reference. ",
