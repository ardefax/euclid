        "Let <var>ABCDEF</var> be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in the circle <var>ABCDEF</var>. ",
        "Let the diameter <var>AD</var> of the circle <var>ABCDEF</var> be drawn; let the centre <var>G</var> of the circle be taken, and with centre <var>D</var> and distance <var>DG</var> let the circle <var>EGCH</var> be described;  let <var>EG</var>, <var>CG</var> be joined and carried through to the points <var>B</var>, <var>F</var>, and let <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var>, <var>CD</var>, <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var>, <var>FA</var> be joined. ",
        "I say that the hexagon <var>ABCDEF</var> is equilateral and equiangular. ",
        "For, since the point <var>G</var> is the centre of the circle <var>ABCDEF</var>, <var>GE</var> is equal to <var>GD</var>.\n       ",
        "Again, since the point <var>D</var> is the centre of the circle <var>GCH</var>, <var>DE</var> is equal to <var>DG</var>.\n      ",
        "But <var>GE</var> was proved equal to <var>GD</var>; therefore <var>GE</var> is also equal to <var>ED</var>; therefore the triangle <var>EGD</var> is equilateral; and therefore its three angles <var>EGD</var>, <var>GDE</var>, <var>DEG</var> are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.5\">I. 5</a>] ",
        "And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>] therefore the angle <var>EGD</var> is one-third of two right angles.\n      ",
        "Similarly, the angle <var>DGC</var> can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles. ",
        "And, since the straight line <var>CG</var> standing on <var>EB</var> makes the adjacent angles <var>EGC</var>, <var>CGB</var> equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle <var>CGB</var> is also one-third of two right angles. ",
        "Therefore the angles <var>EGD</var>, <var>DGC</var>, <var>CGB</var> are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles <var>BGA</var>, <var>AGF</var>, <var>FGE</var> are equal. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.15\">I. 15</a>] ",
        "Therefore the six angles <var>EGD</var>, <var>DGC</var>, <var>CGB</var>, <var>BGA</var>, <var>AGF</var>, <var>FGE</var> are equal to one another. ",
        "But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.26\">III. 26</a>] therefore the six circumferences <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var>, <var>CD</var>, <var>DE</var>, <var>EF</var>, <var>FA</var> are equal to one another. ",
        "And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.29\">III. 29</a>] therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon <var>ABCDEF</var> is equilateral.\n      ",
        "I say next that it is also equiangular. ",
        "For, since the circumference <var>FA</var> is equal to the circumference <var>ED</var>, let the circumference <var>ABCD</var> be added to each; therefore the whole <var>FABCD</var> is equal to the whole <var>EDCBA</var>;\n       and the angle <var>FED</var> stands on the circumference <var>FABCD</var>, and the angle <var>AFE</var> on the circumference <var>EDCBA</var>; therefore the angle <var>AFE</var> is equal to the angle <var>DEF</var>. [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.27\">III. 27</a>]\n      ",
        "Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon <var>ABCDEF</var> are also severally equal to each of the angles <var>AFE</var>, <var>FED</var>; therefore the hexagon <var>ABCDEF</var> is equiangular.\n      ",
        "But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle <var>ABCDEF</var>. "
