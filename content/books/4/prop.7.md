        "Let <var>ABCD</var> be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe a square about the circle <var>ABCD</var>. ",

        "Then, since <var>FG</var> touches the circle <var>ABCD</var>, and <var>EA</var> has been joined from the centre <var>E</var> to the point of contact at <var>A</var>, therefore the angles at <var>A</var> are right. [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.18\">III. 18</a>]\n      ",
