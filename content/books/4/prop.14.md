        "Let <var>ABCDE</var> be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon <var>ABCDE</var>. ",
        "Let the angles <var>BCD</var>, <var>CDE</var> be bisected by the straight lines <var>CF</var>, <var>DF</var> respectively, and from the point <var>F</var>, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines <var>FB</var>, <var>FA</var>, <var>FE</var> be joined to the points <var>B</var>, <var>A</var>, <var>E</var>. \n      ",

        "Now, since the angle <var>BCD</var> is equal to the angle <var>CDE</var>, and the angle <var>FCD</var> is half of the angle <var>BCD</var>, and the angle <var>CDF</var> half of the angle <var>CDE</var>, therefore the angle <var>FCD</var> is also equal to the angle <var>CDF</var>, so that the side <var>FC</var> is also equal to the side <var>FD</var>.
