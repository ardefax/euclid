        "Let <var>ABCDE</var> be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle <var>ABCDE</var>. ",
        "Let <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, <var>D</var>, <var>E</var> be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences <var>AB</var>, <var>BC</var>, <var>CD</var>, <var>DE</var>, <var>EA</var> are equal; [<a href=\"/books/4/#prop.11\">IV. 11</a>]  through <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, <var>D</var>, <var>E</var> let <var>GH</var>, <var>HK</var>, <var>KL</var>, <var>LM</var>, <var>MG</var> be drawn touching the circle; [<a href=\"/books/3/#16.p.1\">III. 16, Por.</a>] let the centre <var>F</var> of the circle <var>ABCDE</var> be taken [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.1\">III. 1</a>], and let <var>FB</var>, <var>FK</var>, <var>FC</var>, <var>FL</var>, <var>FD</var> be joined. ",
        "Then, since the straight line <var>KL</var> touches the circle <var>ABCDE</var> at <var>C</var>, and <var>FC</var> has been joined from the centre <var>F</var> to the point of contact at <var>C</var>, therefore <var>FC</var> is perpendicular to <var>KL</var>; [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.18\">III. 18</a>] therefore each of the angles at <var>C</var> is right.\n      ",
        "For the same reason the angles at the points <var>B</var>, <var>D</var> are also right.\n       ",
        "And, since the angle <var>FCK</var> is right, therefore the square on <var>FK</var> is equal to the squares on <var>FC</var>, <var>CK</var>. ",
        "For the same reason [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.47\">I. 47</a>] the square on <var>FK</var> is also equal to the squares on <var>FB</var>, <var>BK</var>; so that the squares on <var>FC</var>, <var>CK</var> are equal to the squares on <var>FB</var>, <var>BK</var>, of which the square on <var>FC</var> is equal to the square on <var>FB</var>; therefore the square on <var>CK</var> which remains is equal to the square on <var>BK</var>. ",
        "Therefore <var>BK</var> is equal to <var>CK</var>. ",
        "And, since <var>FB</var> is equal to <var>FC</var>, and <var>FK</var> common, the two sides <var>BF</var>, <var>FK</var> are equal to the two sides <var>CF</var>, <var>FK</var>; and the base <var>BK</var> equal to the base <var>CK</var>; therefore the angle <var>BFK</var> is equal to the angle <var>KFC</var>, [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.8\">I. 8</a>] and the angle <var>BKF</var> to the angle <var>FKC</var>. Therefore the angle <var>BFC</var> is double of the angle <var>KFC</var>, and the angle <var>BKC</var> of the angle <var>FKC</var>.\n      ",
        "For the same reason the angle <var>CFD</var> is also double of the angle <var>CFL</var>, and the angle <var>DLC</var> of the angle <var>FLC</var>.\n      ",
        "Now, since the circumference <var>BC</var> is equal to <var>CD</var>, the angle <var>BFC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>CFD</var>. [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.27\">III. 27</a>] ",
        "And the angle <var>BFC</var> is double of the angle <var>KFC</var>, and the angle <var>DFC</var> of the angle <var>LFC</var>; therefore the angle <var>KFC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>LFC</var>.\n      ",
        "But the angle <var>FCK</var> is also equal to the angle <var>FCL</var>; therefore <var>FKC</var>, <var>FLC</var> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <var>FC</var> which is common to them; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.26\">I. 26</a>] therefore the straight line <var>KC</var> is equal to <var>CL</var>, and the angle <var>FKC</var> to the angle <var>FLC</var>.\n      ",
        "And, since <var>KC</var> is equal to <var>CL</var>, therefore <var>KL</var> is double of <var>KC</var>. ",
        "For the same reason it can be proved that <var>HK</var> is also double of <var>BK</var>.\n      ",
        "And <var>BK</var> is equal to <var>KC</var>; therefore <var>HK</var> is also equal to <var>KL</var>.\n      ",
        "Similarly each of the straight lines <var>HG</var>, <var>GM</var>, <var>ML</var> can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines <var>HK</var>, <var>KL</var>; therefore the pentagon <var>GHKLM</var> is equilateral.\n      ",
        "I say next that it is also equiangular. ",
        "For, since the angle <var>FKC</var> is equal to the angle <var>FLC</var>, and the angle <var>HKL</var> was proved double of the angle <var>FKC</var>, and the angle <var>KLM</var> double of the angle <var>FLC</var>, therefore the angle <var>HKL</var> is also equal to the angle <var>KLM</var>.\n      ",
