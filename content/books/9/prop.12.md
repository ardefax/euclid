        "Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D, beginning from an unit, and in continued proportion; I say that, by however many prime numbers D is measured, A will also be measured by the same. \n      ",
        "For let D be measured by any prime number E; I say that E measures A. ",
        "For suppose it does not; now E is prime, and any prime number is prime to any which it does not measure; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.29\">VII. 29</a>] therefore E, A are prime to one another. ",
        "And, since E measures D, let it measure it according to F, therefore E by multiplying F has made D. ",
        "Again, since A measures D according to the units in C, [<a href=\"#elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1\">IX. 11 and Por.</a>] therefore A by multiplying C has made D. ",
        "But, further, E has also by multiplying F made D; therefore the product of A, C is equal to the product of E, F. ",
        "Therefore, as A is to E, so is F to C. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.21\">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures C. ",
        "Let it measure it according to G; therefore E by multiplying G has made C. ",
        "But, further, by the theorem before this, A has also by multiplying B made C. [<a href=\"#elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1\">IX. 11 and Por.</a>] ",
        "Therefore the product of A, B is equal to the product of E, G. ",
        "Therefore, as A is to E, so is G to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.21\">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent: [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures B. ",
        "Let it measure it according to H; therefore E by multiplying H has made B. ",
        "But further A has also by multiplying itself made B; [<a href=\"/books/9/#prop.8\">IX. 8</a>] therefore the product of E, H is equal to the square on A. ",
        "Therefore, as E is to A, so is A to H. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But A, E are prime, primes are also least, [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.21\">VII. 21</a>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] therefore E measures A, as antecedent antecedent. ",
        "But, again, it also does not measure it: which is impossible. ",
        "Therefore E, A are not prime to one another. ",
        "Therefore they are composite to one another. ",
        "But numbers composite to one another are measured by some number. [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.14\">VII. Def. 14</a>] ",
        "And, since E is by hypothesis prime, and the prime is not measured by any number other than itself, therefore E measures A, E, so that E measures A. ",
