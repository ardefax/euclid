        "Let A, B, C be the given three numbers, and let it be required to investigate when it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. \n      ",
        "Now either they are not in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are not prime to one another; or they are not in continued proportion, nor are the extremes of them prime to one another; or they are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them are prime to one another. ",
        "If then A, B, C are in continued proportion, and the extremes of them A, C are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to them. [<a href=\"/books/9/#prop.17\">IX. 17</a>] ",
        "&lt;*&gt;Next, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, the extremes being again prime to one another; I say that in this case also it is impossible to find a fourth proportional to them. ",
        "For, if possible, let D have been found, so that, as <hi rend=\"ital\">A</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">B</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">C</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi>, and let it be contrived that, as B is to C, so is D to E. ",
        "Now, since, as A is to B, so is C to D, and, as B is to C, so is D to E, therefore, <foreign lang=\"la\">ex aequali</foreign>, as A is to C, so is C to E. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.14\">VII. 14</a>] ",
        "But A, C are prime, primes are also least, [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.21\">VII. 21</a>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] ",
        "Therefore A measures C as antecedent antecedent. ",
        "But it also measures itself; therefore A measures A, C which are prime to one another: which is impossible. ",
        "Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional to A, B, C.&lt;*&gt; ",
        "Next, let A, B, C be again in continued proportion, but let A, C not be prime to one another. ",
        "I say that it is possible to find a fourth proportional to them. ",
        "For let B by multiplying C make D; therefore A either measures D or does not measure it. ",
        "First, let it measure it according to E; therefore A by multiplying E has made D. ",
        "But, further, B has also by multiplying C made D; therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, C; therefore, proportionally, as A is to B, so is C to E; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] therefore E has been found a fourth proportional to A, B, C. ",
        "Next, let A not measure D; I say that it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number to A, B, C. ",
        "For, if possible, let E have been found; therefore the product of A, E is equal to the product of B, C. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.19\">VII. 19</a>] ",
        "But the product of B, C is D; therefore the product of A, E is also equal to D. ",
        "Therefore A by multiplying E has made D; therefore A measures D according to E, so that A measures D. ",
        "But it also does not measure it: which is absurd. ",
        "Therefore it is not possible to find a fourth proportional number to A, B, C when A does not measure D. ",
        "Next, let A, B, C not be in continued proportion, nor the extremes prime to one another. ",
        "And let B by multiplying C make D. "
