        "Since BC is the side of an equilateral decagon, therefore the circumference ACB is five times the circumference BC; therefore the circumference AC is quadruple of CB. ",
        "But, as the circumference AC is to CB, so is the angle AEC to the angle CEB; [<a href=\"/books/6/#prop.33\">VI. 33</a>] therefore the angle AEC is quadruple of the angle CEB. ",
        "And, since the angle EBC is equal to the angle ECB, [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.5\">I. 5</a>] therefore the angle AEC is double of the angle ECB. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>] ",
