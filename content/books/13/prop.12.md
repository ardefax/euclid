        "For let the centre D of the circle ABC be taken, let AD be joined and carried through to E, and let BE be joined. ",
        "Then, since the triangle ABC is equilateral, therefore the circumference BEC is a third part of the circumference of the circle ABC. ",
        "Therefore the circumference BE is a sixth part of the circumference of the circle; therefore the straight line BE belongs to a hexagon; therefore it is equal to the radius DE. [<a href=\"/books/4/#15.p.1\">IV. 15, Por.</a>] ",
        "And, since AE is double of DE, the square on AE is quadruple of the square on ED, that is, of the square on BE. ",
