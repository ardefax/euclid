        "For let the straight line AB be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point C, and let AC be the greater segment; let the straight line AD be produced in a straight line with CA, and let AD be made half of AB; I say that the square on CD is five times the square on AD. \n      ",

        "Now, since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C, therefore the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AC. [<a href=\"/books/6/#def.3\">VI. Def. 3</a>, <a href=\"/books/6/#prop.17\">VI. 17</a>] ",
        "And CE is the rectangle AB, BC, and FH the square on AC; therefore CE is equal to FH. ",
