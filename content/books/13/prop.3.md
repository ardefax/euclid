        "For let any straight line AB be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point C, let AC be the greater segment, and let AC be bisected at D; I say that the square on BD is five times the square on DC. \n      ",
        "For let the square AE be described on AB, and let the figure be drawn double. ",
        "Since AC is double of DC, therefore the square on AC is quadruple of the square on DC, that is, RS is quadruple of FG. ",
        "And, since the rectangle AB, BC is equal to the square on AC, and CE is the rectangle AB, BC, therefore CE is equal to RS. ",
        "But RS is quadruple of FG; therefore CE is also quadruple of FG. ",
        "Again, since AD is equal to DC, HK is also equal to KF. ",
        "Hence the square GF is also equal to the square HL. ",
