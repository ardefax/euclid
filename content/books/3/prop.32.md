        "For let a straight line <var>EF</var> touch the circle <var>ABCD</var> at the point <var>B</var>, and from the point <var>B</var> let there be drawn across, in the circle <var>ABCD</var>, a straight line <var>BD</var> cutting it; I say that the angles which <var>BD</var> makes with the tangent <var>EF</var> will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle, that is, that the angle <var>FBD</var> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <var>BAD</var>, and the angle <var>EBD</var> is equal to the angle constructed in the segment <var>DCB</var>. ",

        "Then, since a straight line <var>EF</var> touches the circle <var>ABCD</var> at <var>B</var>, and <var>BA</var> has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle <var>ABCD</var> is on <var>BA</var>.

        "But the angles <var>DBF</var>, <var>DBE</var> are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles <var>DBF</var>, <var>DBE</var> are equal to the angles <var>BAD</var>, <var>BCD</var>, of which the angle <var>BAD</var> was proved equal to the angle <var>DBF</var>; therefore the angle <var>DBE</var> which remains is equal to the angle <var>DCB</var> in the alternate segment <var>DCB</var> of the circle.\n      "
