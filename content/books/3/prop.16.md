        "Let <var>ABC</var> be a circle about <var>D</var> as centre and <var>AB</var> as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from <var>A</var> at right angles to <var>AB</var> from its extremity will fall outside the circle. ",
        "For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as <var>CA</var>, and let <var>DC</var> be joined. ",
        "Since <var>DA</var> is equal to <var>DC</var>, \n       the angle <var>DAC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>ACD</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.5\">I. 5</a>]\n      ",
        "But the angle <var>DAC</var> is right; therefore the angle <var>ACD</var> is also right: thus, in the triangle <var>ACD</var>, the two angles <var>DAC</var>, <var>ACD</var> are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.17\">I. 17</a>] ",
        "Therefore the straight line drawn from the point <var>A</var> at right angles to <var>BA</var> will not fall within the circle. ",

        "Then, since the angle <var>AGD</var> is right, and the angle <var>DAG</var> is less than a right angle, <var>AD</var> is greater than <var>DG</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.19\">I. 19</a>]\n      ",
        "But <var>DA</var> is equal to <var>DH</var>; therefore <var>DH</var> is greater than <var>DG</var>, the less than the greater: which is impossible.\n      ",
        "Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference. ",
        "I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line <var>BA</var> and the circumference <var>CHA</var> is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference <var>CHA</var> and the straight line <var>AE</var> is less than any acute rectilineal angle.
