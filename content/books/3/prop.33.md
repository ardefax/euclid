        "Let <var>AB</var> be the given straight line, and the angle at <var>C</var> the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line <var>AB</var> a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at <var>C</var>. \n      ",
        "The angle at <var>C</var> is then acute, or right, or obtuse. ",
        "First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line <var>AB</var>, and at the point <var>A</var>, let the angle <var>BAD</var> be constructed equal to the angle at <var>C</var>; therefore the angle <var>BAD</var> is also acute.\n      ",
        "Let <var>AE</var> be drawn at right angles to <var>DA</var>, let <var>AB</var> be bisected at <var>F</var>, let <var>FG</var> be drawn from the point <var>F</var> at right angles to <var>AB</var>, and let <var>GB</var> be joined. ",
        "Then, since <var>AF</var> is equal to <var>FB</var>, and <var>FG</var> is common, the two sides <var>AF</var>, <var>FG</var> are equal to the two sides <var>BF</var>, <var>FG</var>; and the angle <var>AFG</var> is equal to the angle <var>BFG</var>; therefore the base <var>AG</var> is equal to the base <var>BG</var>.

        "And the angle <var>BAD</var> is equal to the angle in the segment <var>AEB</var>, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.31\">III. 31</a>] ",
