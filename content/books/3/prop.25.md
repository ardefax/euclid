        "Let <var>ABC</var> be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment <var>ABC</var>, that is, of which it is a segment. ",
        "For let <var>AC</var> be bisected at <var>D</var>, let <var>DB</var> be drawn from the point <var>D</var> at right angles to <var>AC</var>, and let <var>AB</var>. be joined; the angle <var>ABD</var> is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle <var>BAD</var>.\n      ",
        "First let it be greater; and on the straight line <var>BA</var>, and at the point <var>A</var> on it, let the angle <var>BAE</var> be constructed equal to the angle <var>ABD</var>; let <var>DB</var> be drawn through to <var>E</var>, and let <var>EC</var> be joined. ",
        "Then, since the angle <var>ABE</var> is equal to the angle <var>BAE</var>, \n       the straight line <var>EB</var> is also equal to <var>EA</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.6\">I. 6</a>]\n      ",
        "And, since <var>AD</var> is equal to <var>DC</var>, and <var>DE</var> is common, the two sides <var>AD</var>, <var>DE</var> are equal to the two sides <var>CD</var>, <var>DE</var> respectively; and the angle <var>ADE</var> is equal to the angle <var>CDE</var>, for each is right; therefore the base <var>AE</var> is equal to the base <var>CE</var>.\n      ",
        "But <var>AE</var> was proved equal to <var>BE</var>; therefore <var>BE</var> is also equal to <var>CE</var>; therefore the three straight lines <var>AE</var>, <var>EB</var>, <var>EC</var> are equal to one another. ",
        "Therefore the circle drawn with centre <var>E</var> and distance one of the straight lines <var>AE</var>, <var>EB</var>, <var>EC</var> will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [<a href=\"/books/3/#prop.9\">III. 9</a>] ",
        "Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. ",
        "And it is manifest that the segment <var>ABC</var> is less than a semicircle, because the centre <var>E</var> happens to be outside it. ",
        "Similarly, even if the angle <var>ABD</var> be equal to the angle <var>BAD</var>, <var>AD</var> being equal to each of the two <var>BD</var>, <var>DC</var>, the three straight lines <var>DA</var>, <var>DB</var>, <var>DC</var> will be equal to one another, <figure/>\n        <var>D</var> will be the centre of the completed circle, and <var>ABC</var> will clearly be a semicircle.\n       ",
        "But, if the angle <var>ABD</var> be less than the angle <var>BAD</var>, and if we construct, on the straight line <var>BA</var> and at the point <var>A</var> on it, an angle equal to the angle <var>ABD</var>, the centre will fall on <var>DB</var> within the segment <var>ABC</var>, and the segment \n       <var>ABC</var> will clearly be greater than a semicircle.
