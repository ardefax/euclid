        "But the right angle <var>AFE</var> is equal to the right angle <var>BFE</var>, therefore <var>EAF</var>, <var>EBF</var> are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely <var>EF</var>, which is common to them, and subtends one of the equal angles; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to <lb n=\"35\"/>the remaining sides; [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.26\">I. 26</a>] therefore <var>AF</var> is equal to <var>FB</var>.\n      "
