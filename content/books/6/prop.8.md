        "Let <var>ABC</var> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <var>BAC</var> right, and let <var>AD</var> be drawn from <var>A</var> perpendicular to <var>BC</var>; I say that each of the triangles <var>ABD</var>, <var>ADC</var> is similar to the whole <var>ABC</var> and, further, they are similar to one another. ",
        "For, since the angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the angle <var>ADB</var>, for each is right, and the angle at <var>B</var> is common to the two triangles <var>ABC</var> and <var>ABD</var>, therefore the remaining angle <var>ACB</var> is equal to the remaining angle <var>BAD</var>; [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>]  therefore the triangle <var>ABC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>ABD</var>. ",
        "Therefore, as <var>BC</var> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <var>ABC</var> is to <var>BA</var> which subtends the right angle in the triangle <var>ABD</var>, so is <var>AB</var> itself which subtends the angle at <var>C</var> in the triangle <var>ABC</var> to <var>BD</var> which subtends the equal angle <var>BAD</var> in the triangle <var>ABD</var>, and so also is <var>AC</var> to <var>AD</var> which subtends the angle at <var>B</var> common to the two triangles.

        "Therefore the triangle <var>ABC</var> is similar to the triangle <var>ABD</var>. [<a href=\"/books/6/#def.1\">VI. Def. 1</a>] ",
        "Similarly we can prove that the triangle <var>ABC</var> is also similar to the triangle <var>ADC</var>; therefore each of the triangles <var>ABD</var>, <var>ADC</var> is similar to the whole <var>ABC</var>. ",
        "I say next that the triangles <var>ABD</var>, <var>ADC</var> are also similar to one another. ",
        "For, since the right angle <var>BDA</var> is equal to the right angle <var>ADC</var>, and moreover the angle <var>BAD</var> was also proved equal to the angle at <var>C</var>, therefore the remaining angle at <var>B</var> is also equal to the remaining angle <var>DAC</var>; [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <var>ABD</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>ADC</var>.

        "Therefore, as <var>BD</var> which subtends the angle <var>BAD</var> in the triangle <var>ABD</var> is to <var>DA</var> which subtends the angle at <var>C</var> in the triangle <var>ADC</var> equal to the angle <var>BAD</var>, so is <var>AD</var> itself which subtends the angle at <var>B</var> in the triangle <var>ABD</var> to <var>DC</var> which subtends the angle <var>DAC</var> in the triangle <var>ADC</var> equal to the angle at <var>B</var>, and so also is <var>BA</var> to <var>AC</var>, these sides subtending the right angles; [<a href=\"/books/6/#prop.4\">VI. 4</a>] therefore the triangle <var>ABD</var> is similar to the triangle <var>ADC</var>.
