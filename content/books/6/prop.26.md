        "For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let <var>AHC</var> be the diameter &lt; of <var>ABCD</var> &gt;, let <var>GF</var> be produced and carried through to <var>H</var>, and let <var>HK</var> be drawn through <var>H</var> parallel to either of the straight lines <var>AD</var>, <var>BC</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.31\">I. 31</a>] ",
