        "Let <var>ABC</var>, <var>DEF</var> be two triangles having one angle equal to one angle, the angle <var>BAC</var> to the angle <var>EDF</var>, the sides about other angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>DEF</var> proportional, so that, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BC</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>EF</var>, and, first, each of the remaining angles at <var>C</var>, <var>F</var> less than a right angle;  I say that the triangle <var>ABC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>DEF</var>, the angle <var>ABC</var> will be equal to the angle <var>DEF</var>, and the remaining angle, namely the angle at <var>C</var>, equal to the remaining angle, the angle at <var>F</var>. ",
        "For, if the angle <var>ABC</var> is unequal to the angle <var>DEF</var>, one of them is greater. ",
        "Let the angle <var>ABC</var> be greater; and on the straight line <var>AB</var>, and at the point <var>B</var> on it, let the angle <var>ABG</var> be constructed equal to the angle <var>DEF</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.23\">I. 23</a>] ",
        "Then, since the angle <var>A</var> is equal to <var>D</var>, and the angle <var>ABG</var> to the angle <var>DEF</var>, therefore the remaining angle <var>AGB</var> is equal to the remaining angle <var>DFE</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>] ",
        "Therefore the triangle <var>ABG</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>DEF</var>. ",
        "Therefore, as <var>AB</var> is to <var>BG</var>, so is <var>DE</var> to <var>EF</var> [<a href=\"/books/6/#prop.4\">VI. 4</a>] ",
        "But, as <var>DE</var> is to <var>EF</var>, so by hypothesis is <var>AB</var> to <var>BC</var>; therefore <var>AB</var> has the same ratio to each of the straight lines <var>BC</var>, <var>BG</var>; [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.11\">V. 11</a>] therefore <var>BC</var> is equal to <var>BG</var>, [<a href=\"/books/5/#prop.9\">V. 9</a>] so that the angle at <var>C</var> is also equal to the angle <var>BGC</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.5\">I. 5</a>] ",
        "But, by hypothesis, the angle at <var>C</var> is less than a right angle; therefore the angle <var>BGC</var> is also less than a right angle; so that the angle <var>AGB</var> adjacent to it is greater than a right angle. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.13\">I. 13</a>] ",
        "And it was proved equal to the angle at <var>F</var>; therefore the angle at <var>F</var> is also greater than a right angle. ",
        "But it is by hypothesis less than a right angle : which is absurd. ",
        "Therefore the angle <var>ABC</var> is not unequal to the angle <var>DEF</var>; therefore it is equal to it. ",
        "But the angle at <var>A</var> is also equal to the angle at <var>D</var>; therefore the remaining angle at <var>C</var> is equal to the remaining angle at <var>F</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.32\">I. 32</a>] ",
        "Therefore the triangle <var>ABC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>DEF</var>. ",
        "But, again, let each of the angles at <var>C</var>, <var>F</var> be supposed not less than a right angle; I say again that, in this case too, the triangle <var>ABC</var> is equiangular with the triangle <var>DEF</var>. \n      ",
        "For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that <var>BC</var> is equal to <var>BG</var>; so that the angle at <var>C</var> is also equal to the angle <var>BGC</var>. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.5\">I. 5</a>] ",
        "But the angle at <var>C</var> is not less than a right angle; therefore neither is the angle <var>BGC</var> less than a right angle. ",
        "Thus in the triangle <var>BGC</var> the two angles are not less than two right angles: which is impossible. [<a href=\"/books/1/#prop.17\">I. 17</a>] ",
        "Therefore, once more, the angle <var>ABC</var> is not unequal to the angle <var>DEF</var>; therefore it is equal to it. ",
