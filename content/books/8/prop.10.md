        "For let the numbers D, E and F, G respectively fall between the two numbers A, B and the unit C in continued proportion; I say that, as many numbers as have fallen between each of the numbers A, B and the unit C in continued proportion, so many numbers will also fall between A, B in continued proportion.

        "Now, since, as the unit C is to the number D, so is D to E, therefore the unit C measures the number D the same number of times as D measures E. [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.20\">VII. Def. 20</a>] ",
        "But the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D; therefore the number D also measures E according to the units in D; therefore D by multiplying itself has made E. ",

        "But the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D; therefore E also measures A according to the units in D; therefore D by multiplying E has made A. ",
        "For the same reason also F by multiplying itself has made G, and by multiplying G has made B. ",
        "And, since D by multiplying itself has made E and by multiplying F has made H, therefore, as D is to F, so is E to H. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "For the same reason also, as <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">F</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">H</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">G</hi>. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.18\">VII. 18</a>]\n      ",
        "Therefore also, as E is to H, so is H to G. ",

        "But, as E is to H, so is D to F; therefore also, as D is to F, so is A to K. ",

        "But, as D is to F, so is A to K; therefore also, as A is to K, so is K to L. ",
        "Further, since F by multiplying the numbers H, G has made L, B respectively, therefore, as H is to G, so is L to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as H is to G, so is D to F; therefore also, as D is to F, so is L to B. ",
