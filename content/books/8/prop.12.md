        "Let A, B be cube numbers, and let C be the side of A, and D of B; I say that between A, B there are two mean proportional numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to D. \n      ",
        "For let C by multiplying itself make E, and by multiplying D let it make F; let D by multiplying itself make G, and let the numbers C, D by multiplying F make H, K respectively. ",
        "Now, since A is a cube, and C its side, and C by multiplying itself has made E, therefore C by multiplying itself has made E and by multiplying E has made A. ",
        "For the same reason also D by multiplying itself has made G and by multiplying G has made B. ",
        "And, since C by multiplying the numbers C, D has made E, F respectively, therefore, as C is to D, so is E to F. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "For the same reason also, as <hi rend=\"ital\">C</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">F</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">G</hi>. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.18\">VII. 18</a>]\n      ",
        "Again, since C by multiplying the numbers E, F has made A, H respectively, therefore, as E is to F, so is A to H. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as E is to F, so is C to D. ",
        "Therefore also, as C is to D, so is A to H. ",
        "Again, since the numbers C, D by multiplying F have made H, K respectively, therefore, as C is to D, so is H to K. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.18\">VII. 18</a>] ",
        "Again, since D by multiplying each of the numbers F, G has made K, B respectively, therefore, as F is to G, so is K to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as F is to G, so is C to D; therefore also, as C is to D, so is A to H, H to K, and K to B. ",
        "Therefore H, K are two mean proportionals between A, B. ",
        "I say next that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to D. ",
        "For, since A, H, K, B are four numbers in proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to H. [<a href=\"/books/5/#def.10\">V. Def. 10</a>] "
