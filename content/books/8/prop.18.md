        "Let A, B be two similar plane numbers, and let the numbers C, D be the sides of A, and E, F of B. \n      ",
        "Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.21\">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as C is to D, so is E to F. ",
        "I say then that between A, B there is one mean proportional number, and A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which C has to E, or D to F, that is, of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side. ",
        "Now since, as C is to D, so is E to F, therefore, alternately, as C is to E, so is D to F. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.13\">VII. 13</a>] ",
        "And, since A is plane, and C, D are its sides, therefore D by multiplying C has made A. ",
        "For the same reason also E by multiplying F has made B. ",
        "Now let D by multiplying E make G. ",
        "Then, since D by multiplying C has made A, and by multiplying E has made G, therefore, as C is to E, so is A to G. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as C is to E, so is D to F; therefore also, as D is to F, so is A to G. ",
        "Again, since E by multiplying D has made G, and by multiplying F has made B, therefore, as D is to F, so is G to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But it was also proved that, as <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">F</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">A</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">G</hi>; therefore also, as A is to G, so is G to B. ",
        "Therefore A, G, B are in continued proportion. ",
        "Therefore between A, B there is one mean proportional number. ",
        "I say next that A also has to B the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which C has to E or D to F. ",
        "For, since A, G, B are in continued proportion, A has to B the ratio duplicate of that which it has to G. [<a href=\"/books/5/#def.9\">V. Def. 9</a>] ",
        "And, as A is to G, so is C to E, and so is D to F. "
