        "Let A, B be two similar solid numbers, and let C, D, E be the sides of A, and F, G, H of B. ",
        "Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.21\">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore, as C is to D, so is F to G, and, as <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">E</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">G</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">H</hi>.\n      ",
        "I say that between A, B there fall two mean proportional numbers, and A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which C has to F, D to G, and also E to H. \n      ",
        "For let C by multiplying D make K, and let F by multiplying G make L. ",
        "Now, since C, D are in the same ratio with F, G, and K is the product of C, D, and L the product of F, G, K, L are similar plane numbers; [<a href=\"/books/7/#def.21\">VII. Def. 21</a>] therefore between K, L there is one mean proportional number. [<a href=\"/books/8/#prop.18\">VIII. 18</a>] ",
        "Let it be M\n      ",
        "Therefore M is the product of D, F, as was proved in the theorem preceding this. [<a href=\"/books/8/#prop.18\">VIII. 18</a>] ",
        "Now, since D by multiplying C has made K, and by multiplying F has made M, therefore, as C is to F, so is K to M. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as K is to M, so is M to L. ",
        "Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F. ",
        "And since, as C is to D, so is F to G, alternately therefore, as C is to F, so is D to G. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.13\">VII. 13</a>] ",
        "For the same reason also, as <hi rend=\"ital\">D</hi> is to <hi rend=\"ital\">G</hi>, so is <hi rend=\"ital\">E</hi> to <hi rend=\"ital\">H</hi>.\n      ",
        "Therefore K, M, L are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to F, in the ratio of D to G, and also in the ratio of E to H. ",
        "Next, let E, H by multiplying M make N, O respectively. ",
        "Now, since A is a solid number, and C, D, E are its sides, therefore E by multiplying the product of C, D has made A. ",
        "But the product of C, D is K; therefore E by multiplying K has made A. ",
        "For the same reason also <hi rend=\"ital\">H</hi> by multiplying <hi rend=\"ital\">L</hi> has made <hi rend=\"ital\">B</hi>.\n      ",
        "Now, since E by multiplying K has made A, and further also by multiplying M has made N, therefore, as K is to M, so is A to N. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as K is to M, so is C to F, D to G, and also E to H; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N. ",
        "Again, since E, H by multiplying M have made N, O respectively, therefore, as E is to H, so is N to O. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.18\">VII. 18</a>] ",
        "But, as E is to H, so is C to F and D to G; therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so is A to N and N to O. ",
        "Again, since H by multiplying M has made O, and further also by multiplying L has made B, therefore, as M is to L, so is O to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as M is to L, so is C to F, D to G, and E to H. ",
        "Therefore also, as C is to F, D to G, and E to H, so not only is O to B, but also A to N and N to O. ",
        "Therefore A, N, O, B are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides. ",
        "I say that A also has to B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number C has to F, or D to G, and also E to H. ",
        "For, since A, N, O, B are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore A has to B the ratio triplicate of that which A has to N. [<a href=\"/books/5/#def.10\">V. Def. 10</a>] ",
        "But, as A is to N, so it was proved that C is to F, D to G, and also E to H. "
