        "For let one mean proportional number C fall between the two numbers A, B; I say that A, B are similar plane numbers. ",
        "Let D, E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with A, C, be taken; [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.33\">VII. 33</a>] therefore D measures A the same number of times that E measures C. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] ",
        "Now, as many times as D measures A, so many units let there be in F; therefore F by multiplying D has made A, so that A is plane, and D, F are its sides. ",
        "Again, since D, E are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with C, B, therefore D measures C the same number of times that E measures B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.20\">VII. 20</a>] \n      ",
        "As many times, then, as E measures B, so many units let there be in G; therefore E measures B according to the units in G; therefore G by multiplying E has made B. ",
        "Therefore B is plane, and E, G are its sides. ",
        "Therefore A, B are plane numbers. ",
        "I say next that they are also similar. ",
        "For, &lt;*&gt; since F by multiplying D has made A, and by multiplying E has made C, therefore, as D is to E, so is A to C, that is, C to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "Again, &lt;*&gt; since E by multiplying F, G has made C, B respectively, therefore, as F is to G, so is C to B. [<a href=\"/books/7/#prop.17\">VII. 17</a>] ",
        "But, as C is to B, so is D to E; therefore also, as D is to E, so is F to G. ",

It is not necessary to infer from other facts that, as D is to E, so is A to C; for this is part of the hypotheses (ll. 6, 7). Again, there is no explanation of the statement (l. 25) that F by multiplying E has made C. It is the statement and explanation of this latter fact which are alone wanted; after which the proof proceeds as in l. 28. We might therefore substitute for ll. 25-28 the following.</p>\n        <p>“For, since E measures C the same number of times that D measures A [l. 8], that is, according to the units in F [l. 10], therefore F by multiplying E has made C. </p>\n        <p>And, since E by multiplying F, G,”\n etc. etc.</p>\n       </note>"
