       <p>For, if the triangle <var>ABC</var> be applied to the triangle <var>DEF</var>, and if the point <var>A</var> be placed <lb n="20"/>on the point <var>D</var> and the straight line <var>AB</var> on <var>DE</var>, then the point <var>B</var> will also coincide with <var>E</var>, because <var>AB</var> is equal to <var>DE</var>. 
        </p>
       <p>Again, <var>AB</var> coinciding with <var>DE</var>, the straight line <var>AC</var> will also coincide with <var>DF</var>, because the angle <var>BAC</var> is equal to the angle <var>EDF</var>; hence the point <var>C</var> will also coincide with the point <var>F</var>, because <var>AC</var> is again equal to <var>DF</var>.
        </p>
       <p>But <var>B</var> also coincided with <var>E</var>; hence the base <var>BC</var> will coincide with the base <var>EF</var>.</p>
       <p>[For if, when <var>B</var> coincides with <var>E</var> and <var>C</var> with <var>F</var>, the base <var>BC</var> does not coincide with the base <var>EF</var>, two straight lines will enclose a space: which is impossible. Therefore the base <var>BC</var> will coincide with <var>EF</var>] and will be equal to it. [<a href="#elem.1.c.n.4">C.N. 4</a>]</p>
       <p>Thus the whole triangle <var>ABC</var> will coincide with the whole triangle <var>DEF</var>, and will be equal to it.
        </p>
       <p>And the remaining angles will also coincide with the remaining angles and will be equal to them, the angle <var>ABC</var> to the angle <var>DEF</var>, and the angle <var>ACB</var> to the angle <var>DFE</var>.</p>

       <p>Here we have the word <var>base</var> used for the first time in the <title>Elements</title>.

Proclus thus avoids the mistake made by some modern editors who explain the term exclusively with reference to the case where two sides have been mentioned before. That this is an error is proved (1) by the occurrence of the term in the enunciations of <a href="#elem.1.37">I. 37</a> etc. about triangles on the same base and equal bases, (2) by the application of the same term to the bases of parallelograms in <a href="#elem.1.35">I. 35</a> etc. The truth is that the use of the term must have been suggested by the practice of drawing the particular side horizontally, as it were, and the rest of the figure above it. The <var>base</var> of a figure was therefore spoken of, primarily, in the same sense as the base of anything else, e.g. of a pedestal or column; but when, as in <a href="#elem.1.5">I. 5</a>, two triangles were compared occupying other than the normal positions which gave rise to the name, and when two sides had been previously mentioned, the base was, as Proclus says, necessarily the third side.</p>

       <p>Then, since <var>AF</var> is equal to <var>AG</var> and <var>AB</var> to <var>AC</var>, the two sides <var>FA</var>, <var>AC</var> are equal to the two sides <var>GA</var>, <var>AB</var>, respectively; and they contain a common angle, the angle <var>FAG</var>. Therefore the base <var>FC</var> is equal to the base <var>GB</var>, and the triangle <var>AFC</var> is equal to the triangle <var>AGB</var>, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, that is, the angle <var>ACF</var> to the angle <var>ABG</var>, <lb n="25"/>and the angle <var>AFC</var> to the angle <var>AGB</var>.

       <p>In an English translation of the enunciation of this proposition it is absolutely necessary, in order to make it intelligible, to insert some words which are not in the Greek. The reason is partly that the Greek enunciation is itself very elliptical, and partly that some words used in it conveyed more meaning than the corresponding words in English do. Particularly is this the case with <foreign lang="greek">οὐ συσταθήσονται ἐπί</foreign> <quote>there shall not be constructed upon,</quote>
 since <foreign lang="greek">συνίστασθαι</foreign> is the regular word for constructing a <var>triangle</var> in particular. Thus a Greek would easily understahd <foreign lang="greek">συσταθήσονται ἐπί</foreign> as meaning the construction of two lines <var>forming a triangle on</var> a given straight line as base; whereas to <quote>construct two straight lines on a straight line</quote>
 is not in English sufficiently definite unless we explain that they are drawn from the <var>ends</var> of the straight line to <var>meet</var> at a point. I have had the less hesitation in putting in the words <quote>from its extremities</quote>
 because they are actually used by Euclid in the somewhat similar enunciation of <a href="#elem.1.21">I. 21</a>.</p>
       <p>How impossible a literal translation into English is, if it is to convey the meaning of the enunciation intelligibly, will be clear from the following attempt to render literally: <quote>On the same straight line there shall not be constructed two other straight lines equal, each to each, to the same two straight lines, (terminating) at different points on the same side, having the same extremities as the original straight lines</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">ἐπὶ τῆς αὐτῆς εὐθείας δύο ταῖς αὐταῖς εὐθείαις ἄλλαι δύο εὐθεῖαι ἴσαι ἑκατὲρα ἑκατέρα οὐ συσταθήσονται πρὸς ἄλλῳ καἰ ἄλλῳ σημείῳ ἐπἰ τὰ αὐτὰ μέρη τὰ αὐτὰ πέρατα ἔχουσαι ταῖς ἐξ ἀρχῆς εὐθείαις</foreign>).</p>
       <p>The reason why Euclid allowed himself to use, in this enunciation, language apparently so obscure is no doubt that the phraseology was traditional and therefore, vague as it was, had a conventional meaning which the contemporary geometer well understood. This is proved, I think, by the occurrence in Aristotle (<xref n="Aristot. Meteo. 376a.2" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U"><title>Meteorologica</title> III. 5, 376 a 2 sqq.</xref>) of the very same, evidently technical, expressions. Aristotle is there alluding to the theorem given by Eutocius from Apollonius' <title>Plane Loci</title> to the effect that, if <var>H</var>, <var>K</var> be two fixed points and <var>M</var> such a variable point that the ratio of <var>MH</var> to <var>MK</var> is a given ratio (not one of equality), the locus of <var>M</var> is a circle. (For an account of this theorem see note on <a href="#elem.6.3">VI. 3</a> below.) Now Aristotle says <quote>The lines drawn up from <var>H</var>, <var>K</var> in this ratio cannot be constructed to two different points of the semicircle <var>A</var></quote>

       <p>If a paraphrase is allowed instead of a translation adhering as closely as possible to the original, Simson's is the best that could be found, since the fact that the straight lines form <var>triangles</var> on the same base is really conveyed in the Greek. Simson's enunciation is, <title>Upon the same base</title>, <var>and on the same side of it</var>, <var>there cannot be two triangles that have their sides which are terminated in one extremity of the base equal to one another</var>, <var>and likewise those which are terminated at the other extremity</var>. Th. Taylor (the translator of Proclus) attacks Simson's alteration as <quote>indiscreet</quote>
 and as detracting from the beauty and accuracy of Euclid's enunciation which are enlarged upon by Proclus in his commentary. Yet, when Taylor says <quote>Whatever difficulty learners may find in conceiving this proposition abstractedly is easily removed by its exposition in the figure,</quote>
 he really gives his case away. The fact is that Taylor, always enthusiastic over his author, was nettled by Simson's slighting remarks on Proclus' comments on the proposition. Simson had said, with reference to Proclus' explanation of the bearing of the second part of <a href="#elem.1.5">I. 5</a> on <a href="#elem.1.7">I. 7</a>, that it was not <quote>worth while to relate his trifles at full length,</quote>
 to which Taylor retorts <quote>But Mr Simson was no philosopher; and therefore the greatest part of these Commentaries must be considered by him as trifles, from the want of a philosophic genius to comprehend their meaning, and a taste superior to that of a <var>mere mathematician</var>, to discover their beauty and elegance.</quote>

      <div4 type="Proof" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       <p>Let <var>ABC</var>, <var>DEF</var> be two triangles having the two sides <var>AB</var>, <var>AC</var> equal to the two sides <var>DE</var>, <var>DF</var> respectively, namely <var>AB</var> to <var>DE</var>, and <var>AC</var> to <var>DF</var>; and let them have the base <var>BC</var> equal to the base <var>EF</var>; </p>
       <p>I say that the angle <var>BAC</var> is also equal to the angle <var>EDF</var>.</p>
       <p>For, if the triangle <var>ABC</var> be applied to the triangle <var>DEF</var>, and if the point <var>B</var> be placed on the point <var>E</var> and the straight line <var>BC</var> on <var>EF</var>, the point <var>C</var> will also coincide with <var>F</var>, because <var>BC</var> is equal to <var>EF</var>.

       <p>Then, <var>BC</var> coinciding with <var>EF</var>, <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var> will also coincide with <var>ED</var>, <var>DF</var>;
        for, if the base <var>BC</var> coincides with the base <var>EF</var>, and the sides <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var> do not coincide with <var>ED</var>, <var>DF</var> but fall beside them as <var>EG</var>, <var>GF</var>, then, given two straight lines constructed on a straight line (from its extremities) and meeting in a point, there will <lb n="25"/>have been constructed on the same straight line (from its extremities), and on the same side of it, two other straight lines meeting in another point and equal to the former two respectively, namely each to that which has the same extremity with it. <lb n="30"/>But they cannot be so constructed.

       <p>Therefore it is not possible that, if the base <var>BC</var> be applied to the base <var>EF</var>, the sides <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var> should not coincide with <var>ED</var>, <var>DF</var>; they will therefore coincide,

The first term describes the angles made by two straight lines when one only is divided by the other, i.e. when one straight line meets another at a point which is not either of its extremities, but is not itself produced beyond the point of meeting. When the first straight line <var>is</var> produced, so that the lines cross at the point, they make two pairs of <var>vertical</var> angles (which are more clearly described as <var>vertically opposite</var> angles), and which are so called because their convergence is from opposite directions to one point (the intersection of the lines) as vertex (<foreign lang="greek">κορυφή</foreign>).</p>

       <p>Let <var>ACDB</var> be a parallelogrammic area, and <var>BC</var> its diameter; I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram <var>ACDB</var> are equal to one another, and the diameter <var>BC</var> bisects it. </p>
       <p>For, since <var>AB</var> is parallel to <var>CD</var>, and the straight line <var>BC</var> has fallen  upon them, the alternate angles <var>ABC</var>, <var>BCD</var> are equal to one another. [<a href="#elem.1.29">I. 29</a>]</p>

 areas (<foreign lang="greek">παραλληλόγραμμα χωρία</foreign>).

       <p>In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.</p>
      </div4>
      <div4 type="Proof" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       <p>Let <var>ABC</var> be a right-angled triangle having the angle <var>BAC</var> right;</p>
       <p>I say that the square on <var>BC</var> is equal to the squares on <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var>.</p>
       <p>For let there be described on <var>BC</var> the square <var>BDEC</var>, and on <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var> the squares <var>GB</var>, <var>HC</var>; [<a href="#elem.1.46">I. 46</a>] through <var>A</var> let <var>AL</var> be drawn parallel to either <var>BD</var> or <var>CE</var>, and let <var>AD</var>, <var>FC</var> be joined. 
        </p>
       <p>Then, since each of the angles <var>BAC</var>, <var>BAG</var> is right, it follows that with a straight line <var>BA</var>, and at the point <var>A</var> on it, the two straight lines <var>AC</var>, <var>AG</var> not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; therefore <var>CA</var> is in a straight line with <var>AG</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.14">I. 14</a>]
        </p>
       <p>For the same reason <var>BA</var> is also in a straight line with <var>AH</var>.</p>
       <p>And, since the angle <var>DBC</var> is equal to the angle <var>FBA</var>: for each is right: let the angle <var>ABC</var> be added to each; therefore the whole angle <var>DBA</var> is equal to the whole angle <var>FBC</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]
        </p>
       <p>And, since <var>DB</var> is equal to <var>BC</var>, and <var>FB</var> to <var>BA</var>, the two sides <var>AB</var>, <var>BD</var> are equal to the two sides <var>FB</var>, <var>BC</var> respectively, and the angle <var>ABD</var> is equal to the angle <var>FBC</var>; therefore the base <var>AD</var> is equal to the base <var>FC</var>, and the triangle <var>ABD</var> is equal to the triangle <var>FBC</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.4">I. 4</a>]</p>
       <p>Now the parallelogram <var>BL</var> is double of the triangle <var>ABD</var>, for they have the same base <var>BD</var> and are in the same parallels <var>BD</var>, <var>AL</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.41">I. 41</a>]</p>
       <p>And the square <var>GB</var> is double of the triangle <var>FBC</var>, for they again have the same base <var>FB</var> and are in the same parallels <var>FB</var>, <var>GC</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.41">I. 41</a>]</p>
       <p>[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] Therefore the parallelogram <var>BL</var> is also equal to the square <var>GB</var>.</p>
       <p>Similarly, if <var>AE</var>, <var>BK</var> be joined, the parallelogram <var>CL</var> can also be proved equal to the square <var>HC</var>; therefore the whole square <var>BDEC</var> is equal to the two squares <var>GB</var>, <var>HC</var>. [<a href="#elem.1.c.n.2">C.N. 2</a>]</p>
       <p>And the square <var>BDEC</var> is described on <var>BC</var>, and the squares <var>GB</var>, <var>HC</var> on <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var>.</p>
       <p>Therefore the square on the side <var>BC</var> is equal to the squares on the sides <var>BA</var>, <var>AC</var>.</p>

 In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is: <foreign lang="greek">Ἕστω τέσσαρα μεγέθη ἀνάλογον τὰ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, ὡς τὸ Α πρὸς τὸ Β, οὕτως τὸ Γ πρὸς τὸ Δ</foreign>, literally <quote>Let <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, <var>D</var> be four proportional magnitudes, as <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>, so <var>C</var> to <var>D</var>.</quote>
 The same remark applies to the corresponding expressions in the next propositions, <a href="#elem.5.17 elem.5.18">V. 17, 18</a>, and to other forms of expression in <a href="#elem.5.20 elem.5.21 elem.5.22 elem.5.23">V. 20-23</a> and later propositions: e.g. in <a href="#elem.5.20">V. 20</a> we have a phrase meaning literally <quote>Let there be magnitudes...which taken two and two are in the same ratio, as <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>, so <var>D</var> to <var>E</var>,</quote>

[<a href="#elem.1.26">I. 26</a>] </p><p>Therefore GE is equal to EH, and AG to BH. </p><p>And, since AE is equal to EB, while FE is common and at right angles, therefore the base FA is equal to the base FB.

       In equal parallelepipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those parallelepipedal solids in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.
      </p></div4><div4 type="Proof"><p>Let AB, CD be equal parallelepipedal solids; I say that in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB. </p><p>First, let the sides which stand up, namely AG, EF, LB, HK, CM, NO, PD, QR, be at right angles to their bases; I say that, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is CM to AG. </p><p>If now the base EH is equal to the base NQ, while the solid AB is also equal to the solid CD, CM will also be equal to AG. </p><p>For parallelepipedal solids of the same height are to one another as the bases; [<a href="#elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as the base EH is to NQ, so will CM be to AG, and it is manifest that in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p><p>Next, let the base EH not be equal to the base NQ, but let EH be greater. 
      </p><p>Now the solid AB is equal to the solid CD; therefore CM is also greater than AG. </p><p>Let then CT be made equal to AG, and let the parallelepipedal solid VC be completed on NQ as base and with CT as height. </p><p>Now, since the solid AB is equal to the solid CD, and CV is outside them, while equals have to the same the same ratio, [<a href="#elem.5.7">V. 7</a>] therefore, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is the solid CD to the solid CV. </p><p>But, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is the base EH to the base NQ, for the solids AB, CV are of equal height; [<a href="#elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as the solid CD is to the solid CV, so is the base MQ to the base TQ [<a href="#elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] and CM to CT [<a href="#elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>]; therefore also, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC to CT. </p><p>But CT is equal to AG; therefore also, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC to AG. </p><p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p><p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so let the height of the solid CD be to the height of the solid AB; I say that the solid AB is equal to the solid CD. </p><p>Let the sides which stand up be again at right angles to the bases. </p><p>Now, if the base EH is equal to the base NQ, and, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB, therefore the height of the solid CD is also equal to the height of the solid AB. </p><p>But parallelepipedal solids on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [<a href="#elem.11.31">XI. 31</a>] therefore the solid AB is equal to the solid CD. </p><p>Next, let the base EH not be equal to the base NQ, but let EH be greater; therefore the height of the solid CD is also greater than the height of the solid AB, that is, CM is greater than AG. </p><p>Let CT be again made equal to AG, and let the solid CV be similarly completed. </p><p>Since, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is MC to AG, while AG is equal to CT, therefore, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is CM to CT. </p><p>But, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the solid AB to the solid CV, for the solids AB, CV are of equal height; [<a href="#elem.11.32">XI. 32</a>] and, as CM is to CT, so is the base MQ to the base QT [<a href="#elem.6.1">VI. 1</a>] and the solid CD to the solid CV. [<a href="#elem.11.25">XI. 25</a>] </p><p>Therefore also, as the solid AB is to the solid CV, so is the solid CD to the solid CV; therefore each of the solids AB, CD has to CV the same ratio. </p><p>Therefore the solid AB is equal to the solid CD. [<a href="#elem.5.9">V. 9</a>] </p><p>Now let the sides which stand up, FE, BL, GA, HK, ON, DP, MC, RQ, not be at right angles to their bases; let perpendiculars be drawn from the points F, G, B, K, O, M, D, R to the planes through EH, NQ, and let them meet the planes at S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, a, and let the solids FV, Oa be completed; I say that, in this case too, if the solids AB, CD are equal, the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB. 
      </p><p>Since the solid AB is equal to the solid CD, while AB is equal to BT, for they are on the same base FK and of the same height; [<a href="#elem.11.29 elem.11.30">XI. 29, 30</a>] and the solid CD is equal to DX, for they are again on the same base RO and of the same height; [id.] therefore the solid BT is also equal to the solid DX. </p><p>Therefore, as the base FK is to the base OR, so is the height of the solid DX to the height of the solid BT. [Part 1.] </p><p>But the base FK is equal to the base EH, and the base OR to the base NQ; therefore, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid DX to the height of the solid BT. </p><p>But the solids DX, BT and the solids DC, BA have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid DC to the height of the solid AB. </p><p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights. </p><p>Again, in the parallelepipedal solids AB, CD let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so let the height of the solid CD be to the height of the solid AB; I say that the solid AB is equal to the solid CD. </p><p>For, with the same construction, since, as the base EH is to the base NQ, so is the height of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB, while the base EH is equal to the base FK, and NQ to OR, therefore, as the base FK is to the base OR, so is the height of the solid CD to the height of the solid AB. </p><p>But the solids AB, CD and BT, DX have the same heights respectively; therefore, as the base FK is to the base OR, so is the height of the solid DX to the height of the solid BT. </p><p>Therefore in the parallelepipedal solids BT, DX the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; therefore the solid BT is equal to the solid DX.

    <head>BOOK XII.</head>
    <head>HISTORICAL NOTE.</head>
    <p>The predominant feature of Book XII. is the use of the method of exhaustion, which is applied in Propositions <a href="#elem.12.2">2</a>, <a href="#elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5">3-5</a>, <a href="#elem.12.10 elem.12.11 elem.12.12">10, 11, 12</a>, and (in a slightly different form) in <a href="#elem.12.16 elem.12.17 elem.12.18">Propositions 16-18</a>. We conclude therefore that for the content of this Book Euclid was greatly indebted to Eudoxus, to whom the discovery of the method of exhaustion is attributed. The evidence for this attribution comes mainly from Archimedes. (1) In the preface to <title>On the Sphere and Cylinder</title> I., after stating the main results obtained by himself regarding the surface of a sphere or a segment thereof, and the volume and surface of a right cylinder with height equal to its diameter as compared with those of a sphere with the same diameter, Archimedes adds: <quote>Having now discovered that the properties mentioned are true of these figures, I cannot feel any hesitation in setting them side by side both with my former investigations and with those of the theorems of Eudoxus on solids which are held to be most irrefragably established, namely that any pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height [i.e. Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.7">XII. 7</a>], and that any cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height [i.e. Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.10">XII. 10</a>]. For, though these properties also were naturally inherent in the figures all along, yet they were in fact unknown to all the many able geometers who lived before Eudoxus and had not been observed by any one.</quote>
 (2) In the preface to the treatise known as the <title>Quadrature of the Parabola</title> Archimedes states the <quote>lemma</quote>
 assumed by him and known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 (see note on <a href="#elem.10.1">X. 1</a> above) and proceeds: <quote>Earlier geometers (<foreign lang="greek">οἱ πρότερον γεωμέτραι</foreign>) have also used this lemma; for it is by the use of this same lemma that they have shown that circles are to one another in the duplicate ratio of their diameters [Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.2">XII. 2</a>], and that spheres are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their diameters [Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.18">XII. 18</a>], and further that every pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height [Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.7">XII. 7</a>]; also, that every cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base with the cone and equal height [Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.10">XII. 10</a>] they proved by assuming a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid.</quote>
 Thus in the first passage two theorems of Eucl. XII. are definitely attributed to Eudoxus; and, when Archimedes says, in the second passage, that <quote>earlier geometers</quote>
 proved these two theorems by means of the lemma known as the <quote>Axiom of Archimedes</quote>
 and of a lemma similar to it respectively, we can hardly suppose him to be alluding to any other proof than that given by Eudoxus. As a matter of fact, the lemma used by Euclid to prove both propositions (<a href="#elem.12.3 elem.12.4 elem.12.5">XII. 3-5</a> and <a href="#elem.12.7">7</a>, and <a href="#elem.12.10">XII. 10</a>) is the theorem of Eucl. <a href="#elem.10.1">X. 1</a>. As regards the connexion between the two <quote>lemmas</quote>
 see note on <a href="#elem.10.1">X. 1</a>. </p>
    <p>We are not, however, to suppose that none of the results obtained by the method of exhaustion had been discovered before the time of Eudoxus (fl. about 368-5 B.C.). Two at least are of earlier date, those of <a href="#elem.12.2">Eucl. XII. 2</a> and <a href="#elem.12.7">XII. 7</a>. </p>
    <p>（a) Simplicius (<title>Comment. in Aristot. Phys.</title> p. 61, ed. Diels) quotes Eudemus as saying, in his <title>History of Geometry</title>, that Hippocrates of Chios (fl. say 430 B.C.) first laid it down (<foreign lang="greek">ἔθετο</foreign>) that similar segments of circles are in the ratio of the squares on their bases and that he proved this (<foreign lang="greek">ἐδείκνυεν</foreign>) by proving (<foreign lang="greek">ἐκ τοῦ δεῖξαι</foreign>) that the squares on the diameters have the same ratio as the (whole) circles. We know nothing of the method by which Hippocrates proved this proposition; but, having regard to the evidence from Archimedes quoted above, it is not permissible to suppose that the method was the fully developed method of exhaustion as we know it. </p>
    <p>（b) As regards the two theorems about the volume of a pyramid and of a cone respectively, which Eudoxus was the first to prove, we now have authentic evidence in the short treatise by Archimedes discovered by Heiberg in a MS. at Constantinople in 1906 and published in <title>Hermes</title> the following year (see now <title>Archimedis opera omnia</title>, ed. Heiberg, 2. ed., Vol. II., 1913, pp. 425-507; T. L. Heath, <title>The Method of Archimedes</title>, Cambridge, 1912). The said treatise, complete in all essentials, bears the title <foreign lang="greek">Ἀρχιμήδους περὶ τῶν μηχανικῶν θεωρημάτων πρὸς Ἐρατοσθένην ἔφοδος</foreign>. This <quote>Method</quote>
 (or <quote>Plan of attack</quote>
), addressed to Eratosthenes, is none other than the <foreign lang="greek">ἐφόδιον</foreign> on which, according to Suidas, Theodosius wrote a commentary, and which is several times cited by Heron in his <title>Metrica</title>; its discovery adds a new and important chapter to the history of the integral calculus. In the preface to this work Archimedes alludes to the theorems which he first discovered by means of mechanical considerations, but proved afterwards by geometry, because the investigation by means of mechanics did not constitute a rigid proof; he observes, however, that the mechanical method is of great use for the discovery of theorems, and it is much easier to provide the rigid proof when the fact to be proved has once been discovered than it would be if nothing were known to begin with. He goes on: <quote>Hence too, in the case of those theorems the proof of which was first discovered by Eudoxus, namely those relating to the cone and the pyramid, that the cone is one third part of the cylinder, and the pyramid one third part of the prism, having the same base and equal height, no small part of the credit will naturally be assigned to Democritus, who was the first to make the statement (of the fact) regarding the said figure [i.e. property], though without proving it.</quote>
 Hence the discovery of the two theorems must now be attributed to Democritus (fl. towards the end of 5th cent. B.C.). The words <quote>without proving it</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">χωρὶς ἀποδείξεως</foreign>) do not mean that Democritus gave no sort of proof, but only that he did not give a proof on the rigorous lines required later; for the same words are used by Archimedes of his own investigations by means of mechanics, which, however, do constitute a reasoned argument. The character of Archimedes' mechanical arguments combined with a passage of Plutarch about a particular question in infinitesimals said to have been raised by Democritus may perhaps give a clue to the line of Democritus' argument as regards the pyramid. The essential feature of Archimedes' mechanical arguments in this tract is that he regards an area as the sum of an infinite number of siraight lines parallel to one another and terminated by the boundary or boundaries of the closed figure the area of which is to be found, and a volume as the sum of an infinite number of plane sections parallel to one another: which is of course the same thing as taking (as we do in the integral calculus) the sum of an infinite number of strips of breadth dx (say), when dx becomes indefinitely small, or the sum of an infinite number of parallel laminae of depth dz (say), when dz becomes indefinitely small. To give only one instance, we may take the case of the area of a segment of a parabola cut off by a chord. </p>
    <p>Let CBA be the parabolic segment, CE the tangent at C meeting the  diameter EBD through the middle point of the chord CA in E, so that .
    </p>
    <p>Draw AF parallel to ED meeting CE produced in F. Produce CB to H so that , where K is the point in which CH meets AF; and suppose CH to be a lever. </p>
    <p>Let any diameter MNPO be drawn meeting the curve in P and CF, CK, CA in M, N, O respectively. </p>
    <p>Archimedes then observes that  (<quote>for this is proved in a lemma</quote>
), whence , so that, if a straight line TG equal to PO be placed with its middle point at H, the straight line MO with centre of gravity at N, and the straight line TG with centre of gravity at H, will balance about K. </p>
    <p>Taking all other parts of diameters like PO intercepted between the curve and CA, and placing equal straight lines with their centres of gravity at H, these straight lines collected at H will balance (about K) all the lines like MO parallel to FA intercepted within the triangle CFA in the positions in which they severally lie in the figure. </p>
    <p>Hence Archimedes infers that an area equal to that of the parabolic segment hung at H will balance (about K) the triangle CFA hung at its centre of gravity, the point X (a point on CK such that ), and therefore that  ,
     from which it follows that .
    </p>
    <p>The same sort of argument is used for solids, plane sections taking the place of straight lines. </p>
    <p>Archimedes is careful to state once more that this method of argument does not constitute a proof. Thus, at the end of the above proposition about the parabolic segment, he adds: <quote>This property is of course not proved by what has just been said; but it has furnished a sort of indication (<foreign lang="greek">ἔμφασίν τινα</foreign>) that the conclusion is true.</quote>
 </p>
    <p>Let us now turn to the passage of Plutarch (<title>De Comm. Not. adv. Stoicos</title> XXXIX 3) about Democritus above referred to. Plutarch speaks of Democritus as having raised the question in natural philosophy (<foreign lang="greek">φυσικῶς</foreign>): <quote>if a cone were cut by a plane parallel to the base [by which is clearly meant a plane indefinitely near to the base], what must we think of the surfaces of the sections, that they are equal or unequal? For, if they are unequal, they will make the cone irregular, as having many indentations, like steps, and unevennesses; but, if they are equal, the sections will be equal, and the cone will appear to have the property of the cylinder and to be made up of equal, not unequal circles, which is very absurd.</quote>
 The phrase <quote>made up of equal...circles</quote>
 (<foreign lang="greek">ἐξ ἴσων συγκείμενος...κύκλων</foreign>) shows that Democritus already had the idea of a solid being the sum of an infinite number of parallel planes, or indefinitely thin laminae, indefinitely near together: a most important anticipation of the same thought which led to such fruitful results in Archimedes. If then one may hazard a conjecture as to Democritus' argument with regard to a pyramid, it seems probable that he would notice that, if two pyramids of the same height and equal triangular bases are respectively cut by planes parallel to the base and dividing the heights in the same ratio, the corresponding sections of the two pyramids are equal, whence he would infer that the pyramids are equal as being the sum of the same infinite number of equal plane sections or indefinitely thin laminae. (This would be a particular anticipation of Cavalieri's proposition that the areal or solid contents of two figures are equal if two sections of them taken at the same height, whatever the height may be, always give equal straight lines or equal surfaces respectively.) And Democritus would of course see that the three pyramids into which a prism on the same base and of equal height with the original pyramid is divided (as in Eucl. <a href="#elem.12.7">XII. 7</a>) satisfy this test of equality, so that the pyramid would be one third part of the prism. The extension to a pyramid with a polygonal base would be easy. And Democritus may have stated the proposition for the cone (of course without an absolute proof) as a natural inference from the result of increasing indefinitely the number of sides in a regular polygon forming the base of a pyramid.</p>

    <head>HISTORICAL NOTE.</head>
    <p>I have already given, in the note to <a href="#elem.4.10">IV. 10</a>, the evidence upon which the construction of the five regular solids is attributed to the Pythagoreans. Some of them, the cube, the tetrahedron (which is nothing but a pyramid), and the octahedron (which is only a double pyramid with a square base), cannot but have been known to the Egyptians. And it appears that dodecahedra have been found, of bronze or other material, which may belong to periods earlier than Pythagoras' time by some centuries (for references see Cantor's <title>Geschichte der Mathematik</title> I_{3}, pp. 175-6). </p>
    <p>It is true that the author of the scholium No. I to Eucl. XIII. says that the Book is about <quote>the five so-called Platonic figures, which however do not belong to Plato, three of the aforesaid five figures being due to the Pythagoreans, namely the cube, the pyramid and the dodecahedron, while the octahedron and the icosahedron are due to Theaetetus.</quote>
 This statement (taken probably from Geminus) may perhaps rest on the fact that Theaetetus was the first to write at any length about the two last-mentioned solids. We are told indeed by Suidas (S. V. <foreign lang="greek">Θεαίτητος</foreign>) that Theaetetus <quote>first wrote on the ’five solids’ as they are called.</quote>
 This no doubt means that Theaetetus was the first to write a complete and systematic treatise on all the regular solids; it does not exclude the possibility that Hippasus or others had already written on the dodecahedron. The fact that Theaetetus wrote upon the regular solids agrees very well with the evidence which we possess of his contributions to the theory of irrationals, the connexion between which and the investigation of the regular solids is seen in Euclid's Book XIII. </p>
    <p>Theaetetus flourished about 380 B.C., and his work on the regular solids was soon followed by another, that of Aristaeus, an elder contemporary of Euclid, who also wrote an important book on <title>Solid Loci</title>, i.e. on conics treated as loci. This Aristaeus (known as <quote>the elder</quote>
) wrote in the period about 320 B.C. We hear of his <title>Comparison of the five regular solids</title> from Hypsicles (2nd cent. B.C.), the writer of the short book commonly included in the editions of the <title>Elements</title> as Book XIV. Hypsicles gives in this Book some six propositions supplementing Eucl. XIII.; and he introduces the second of the propositions (Heiberg's Euclid, Vol. v. p. 6) as follows: </p>
    <p><quote>The same circle circumscribes both the pentagon of the dodecahedron and the triangle of the icosahedron when both are inscribed in the same sphere. This is proved by Aristaeus in the book entitled <title>Comparison of the five figures</title>.</quote>
 </p>
    <p>Hypsicles proceeds (pp. 7 sqq.) to give a proof of this theorem. Allman pointed out (<title>Greek Geometry from Thales to Euclid</title>, 1889, pp. 201-2) that this proof depends on eight theorems, six of which appear in Euclid's Book XIII. (in Propositions <a href="#elem.13.8">8</a>, <a href="#elem.13.10">10</a>, <a href="#elem.13.12">12</a>, <a href="#elem.13.15 elem.13.16 elem.13.17">15, 16 with Por., 17</a>); two other propositions not mentioned by Allman are also used, namely <a href="#elem.13.4 elem.13.9">XIII. 4 and 9</a>. This seems, as Allman says, to confirm the inference of Bretschneider (p. 171) that, as Aristaeus' work was the newest and latest in which, before Euclid's time, this subject was treated, we have in Eucl. XIII. at least a partial recapitulation of the contents of the treatise of Aristaeus. </p>
    <p>After Euclid, Apollonius wrote on the comparison of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron inscribed in one and the same sphere. This we also learn from Hypsicles, who says in the next words following those about Aristaeus above quoted: <quote>But it is proved by Apollonius in the second edition of his <title>Comparison of the dodecahedron with the icosahedron</title> that, as the surface of the dodecahedron is to the surface of the icosahedron [inscribed in the same sphere], so is the dodecahedron itself [i.e. its volume] to the icosahedron, because the perpendicular is the same from the centre of the sphere to the pentagon of the dodecahedron and to the triangle of the icosahedron.</quote>

      </p></div4><div4 type="Proof"><p>For in the circle ABCDE which has its diameter rational let the equilateral pentagon ABCDE be inscribed; I say that the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor. </p><p>For let the centre of the circle, the point F, be taken, let AF, FB be joined and carried through to the points, G, H, let AC be joined, and let FK be made a fourth part of AF. </p><p>Now AF is rational; therefore FK is also rational. </p><p>But BF is also rational; therefore the whole BK is rational. </p><p>And, since the circumference ACG is equal to the circumference ADG, and in them ABC is equal to AED, therefore the remainder CG is equal to the remainder GD. </p><p>And, if we join AD, we conclude that the angles at L are right, and CD is double of CL. </p><p>For the same reason the angles at M are also right, and AC is double of CM. 
      </p><p>Since then the angle ALC is equal to the angle AMF, and the angle LAC is common to the two triangles ACL and AMF, therefore the remaining angle ACL is equal to the remaining angle MFA; [<a href="#elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle ACL is equiangular with the triangle AMF; therefore, proportionally, as LC is to CA, so is MF to FA. </p><p>And the doubles of the antecedents may be taken; therefore, as the double of LC is to CA, so is the double of MF to FA. </p><p>But, as the double of MF is to FA, so is MF to the half of FA; therefore also, as the double of LC is to CA, so is MF to the half of FA. </p><p>And the halves of the consequents may be taken; therefore, as the double of LC is to the half of CA, so is MF to the fourth of FA. </p><p>And DC is double of LC, CM is half of CA, and FK a fourth part of FA; therefore, as DC is to CM, so is MF to FK. </p><p><foreign lang="la">Componendo</foreign> also, as the sum of DC, CM is to CM, so is MK to KF; [<a href="#elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] therefore also, as the square on the sum of DC, CM is to the square on CM, so is the square on MK to the square on KF. </p><p>And since, when the straight line subtending two sides of the pentagon, as AC, is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is equal to the side of the pentagon, that is, to DC, [<a href="#elem.13.8">XIII. 8</a>] while the square on the greater segment added to the half of the whole is five times the square on the half of the whole, [<a href="#elem.13.1">XIII. 1</a>] and CM is half of the whole AC, therefore the square on DC, CM taken as one straight line is five times the square on CM. </p><p>But it was proved that, as the square on DC, CM taken as one straight line is to the square on CM, so is the square on MK to the square on KF; therefore the square on MK is five times the square on KF. </p><p>But the square on KF is rational, for the diameter is rational; therefore the square on MK is also rational; therefore MK is rational </p><p>And, since BF is quadruple of FK, therefore BK is five times KF; therefore the square on BK is twenty-five times the square on KF. </p><p>But the square on MK is five times the square on KF; therefore the square on BK is five times the square on KM; therefore the square on BK has not to the square on KM the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BK is incommensurable in length with KM. [<a href="#elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p><p>And each of them is rational. </p><p>Therefore BK, KM are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. </p><p>But, if from a rational straight line there be subtracted a rational straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only, the remainder is irrational, namely an apotome; therefore MB is an apotome and MK the annex to it. [<a href="#elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p><p>I say next that MB is also a fourth apotome. </p><p>Let the square on N be equal to that by which the square on BK is greater than the square on KM; therefore the square on BK is greater than the square on KM by the square on N. </p><p>And, since KF is commensurable with FB, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign> also, KB is commensurable with FB. [<a href="#elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p><p>But BF is commensurable with BH; therefore BK is also commensurable with BH. [<a href="#elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p><p>And, since the square on BK is five times the square on KM, therefore the square on BK has to the square on KM the ratio which 5 has to 1. </p><p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, the square on BK has to the square on N the ratio which 5 has to 4 [<a href="#elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>], and this is not the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore BK is incommensurable with N; [<a href="#elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on BK is greater than the square on KM by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BK. </p><p>Since then the square on the whole BK is greater than the square on the annex KM by the square on a straight line incommensurable with BK, and the whole BK is commensurable with the rational straight line, BH, set out, therefore MB is a fourth apotome.

      </p></div4><div4 type="Proof"><p>Let ABCD, CBEF, two planes of the aforesaid cube at right angles to one another, be set out, let the sides AB, BC, CD, DA, EF, EB, FC be bisected at G, H, K, L, M, N, O respectively, let GK, HL, MH, NO be joined, let the straight lines NP, PO, HQ be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the points R, S, T respectively, and let RP, PS, TQ be their greater segments; from the points R, S, T let RU, SV, TW be set up at right angles to the planes of the cube towards the outside of the cube, let them be made equal to RP, PS, TQ, and let UB, BW, WC, CV, VU be joined. 
      </p><p>I say that the pentagon UBWCV is equilateral, and in one plane, and is further equiangular. </p><p>For let RB, SB, VB be joined. </p><p>Then, since the straight line NP has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at R, and RP is the greater segment, therefore the squares on PN, NR are triple of the square on RP. [<a href="#elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p><p>But PN is equal to NB, and PR to RU; therefore the squares on BN, NR are triple of the square on RU. </p><p>But the square on BR is equal to the squares on BN, NR; [<a href="#elem.1.47">I. 47</a>] therefore the square on BR is triple of the square on RU; hence the squares on BR, RU are quadruple of the square on RU. </p><p>But the square on BU is equal to the squares on BR, RU; therefore the square on BU is quadruple of the square on RU; therefore BU is double of RU. </p><p>But VU is also double of UR, inasmuch as SR is also double of PR, that is, of RU; therefore BU is equal to UV. </p><p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines BW, WC, CV is also equal to each of the straight lines BU, UV. </p><p>Therefore the pentagon BUVCW is equilateral. </p><p>I say next that it is also in one plane. </p><p>For let PX be drawn from P parallel to each of the straight lines RU, SV and towards the outside of the cube, and let XH, HW be joined; I say that XHW is a straight line. </p><p>For, since HQ has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at T, and QT is its greater segment, therefore, as HQ is to QT, so is QT to TH. </p><p>But HQ is equal to HP, and QT to each of the straight lines TW, PX; therefore, as HP is to PX, so is WT to TH. </p><p>And HP is parallel to TW, for each of them is at right angles to the plane BD; [<a href="#elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] and TH is parallel to PX, for each of them is at right angles to the plane BF. [id.] </p><p>But if two triangles, as XPH, HTW, which have two sides proportional to two sides be placed together at one angle so that their corresponding sides are also parallel, the remaining straight lines will be in a straight line; [<a href="#elem.6.32">VI. 32</a>] therefore XH is in a straight line with HW. </p><p>But every straight line is in one plane; [<a href="#elem.11.1">XI. 1</a>] therefore the pentagon UBWCV is in one plane. </p><p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p><p>For, since the straight line NP has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at R, and PR is the greater segment, while PR is equal to PS, therefore NS has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at P, and NP is the greater segment; [<a href="#elem.13.5">XIII. 5</a>] therefore the squares on NS, SP are triple of the square on NP. [<a href="#elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p><p>But NP is equal to NB, and PS to SV; therefore the squares on NS, SV are triple of the square on NB; hence the squares on VS, SN, NB are quadruple of the square on NB. </p><p>But the square on SB is equal to the squares on SN, NB; therefore the squares on BS, SV, that is, the square on BV —for the angle VSB is right—is quadruple of the square on NB; therefore VB is double of BN. </p><p>But BC is also double of BN; therefore BV is equal to BC. </p><p>And, since the two sides BU, UV are equal to the two sides BW, WC, and the base BV is equal to the base BC, therefore the angle BUV is equal to the angle BWC. [<a href="#elem.1.8">I. 8</a>] </p><p>Similarly we can prove that the angle UVC is also equal to the angle BWC; therefore the three angles BWC, BUV, UVC are equal to one another. </p><p>But if in an equilateral pentagon three angles are equal to one another, the pentagon will be equiangular, [<a href="#elem.13.7">XIII. 7</a>] therefore the pentagon BUVCW is equiangular. </p><p>And it was also proved equilateral; therefore the pentagon BUVCW is equilateral and equiangular, and it is on one side BC of the cube. </p><p>Therefore, if we make the same construction in the case of each of the twelve sides of the cube, a solid figure will have been constructed which is contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, and which is called a dodecahedron. </p><p>It is then required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p><p>For let XP be produced, and let the produced straight line be XZ; therefore PZ meets the diameter of the cube, and they bisect one another, for this has been proved in the last theorem but one of the eleventh book. [<a href="#elem.11.38">XI. 38</a>] </p><p>Let them cut at Z; therefore Z is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube, and ZP is half of the side of the cube. </p><p>Let UZ be joined. </p><p>Now, since the straight line NS has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at P, and NP is its greater segment, therefore the squares on NS, SP are triple of the square on NP. [<a href="#elem.13.4">XIII. 4</a>] </p><p>But NS is equal to XZ, inasmuch as NP is also equal to PZ, and XP to PS. </p><p>But further PS is also equal to XU, since it is also equal to RP; therefore the squares on ZX, XU are triple of the square on NP. </p><p>But the square on UZ is equal to the squares on ZX, XU; therefore the square on UZ is triple of the square on NP. </p><p>But the square on the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube is also triple of the square on the half of the side of the cube, for it has previously been shown how to construct a cube and comprehend it in a sphere, and to prove that the square on the diameter of the sphere is triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<a href="#elem.13.15">XIII. 15</a>] </p><p>But, if whole is so related to whole, so is half to half also; and NP is half of the side of the cube; therefore UZ is equal to the radius of the sphere which comprehends the cube. </p><p>And Z is the centre of the sphere which comprehends the cube; therefore the point U is on the surface of the sphere. </p><p>Similarly we can prove that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere; therefore the dodecahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere. </p><p>I say next that the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straight line called apotome. </p><p>For since, when NP has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, RP is the greater segment, and, when PO has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, PS is the greater segment, therefore, when the whole NO is cut in extreme and mean ratio, RS is the greater segment. </p><p>[Thus, since, as NP is to PR, so is PR to RN, the same is true of the doubles also, for parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples; [<a href="#elem.5.15">V. 15</a>] therefore as NO is to RS, so is RS to the sum of NR, SO. </p><p>But NO is greater than RS; therefore RS is also greater than the sum of NR, SO; therefore NO has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and RS is its greater segment.] </p><p>But RS is equal to UV; therefore, when NO is cut in extreme and mean ratio, UV is the greater segment. </p><p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is triple of the square on the side of the cube, therefore NO, being a side of the cube, is rational. </p><p>[But if a rational line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, each of the segments is an irrational apotome.] </p></div4><div4 type="QED"><p>Therefore UV, being a side of the dodecahedron, is an irrational apotome.

      </p><p><foreign lang="la">Convertendo</foreign>, therefore, BA is one and a half times AD. </p><p>But, as BA is to AD, so is the square on BA to the square on AF, [<a href="#elem.5.def.9">V.

[<a href="#elem.13.13">XIII. 13</a>] </p><p>And AB is the diameter of the sphere; therefore AF is equal to the side of the pyramid. </p><p>Again, since AD is double of DB, therefore AB is triple of BD. </p><p>But, as AB is to BD, so is the square on AB to the square on BF; [<a href="#elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>, <a href="#elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore the square on AB is triple of the square on BF. </p><p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also triple of the square on the side of the cube. [<a href="#elem.13.15">XIII. 15</a>] </p><p>And AB is the diameter of the sphere; therefore BF is the side of the cube. </p><p>And, since AC is equal to CB, therefore AB is double of BC. </p><p>But, as AB is to BC, so is the square on AB to the square on BE; therefore the square on AB is double of the square on BE. </p><p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also double of the square on the side of the octahedron. [<a href="#elem.13.14">XIII. 14</a>] </p><p>And AB is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore BE is the side of the octahedron. </p><p>Next, let AG be drawn from the point A at right angles to the straight line AB, let AG be made equal to AB, let GC be joined, and from H let HK be drawn perpendicular to AB. </p><p>Then, since GA is double of AC, for GA is equal to AB, and, as GA is to AC, so is HK to KC, therefore HK is also double of KC. </p><p>Therefore the square on HK is quadruple of the square on KC; therefore the squares on HK, KC, that is, the square on HC, is five times the square on KC. </p><p>But HC is equal to CB; therefore the square on BC is five times the square on CK. </p><p>And, since AB is double of CB, and, in them, AD is double of DB, therefore the remainder BD is double of the remainder DC. </p><p>Therefore BC is triple of CD; therefore the square on BC is nine times the square on CD. </p><p>But the square on BC is five times the square on CK; therefore the square on CK is greater than the square on CD; therefore CK is greater than CD. </p><p>Let CL be made equal to CK, from L let LM be drawn at right angles to AB, and let MB be joined. </p><p>Now, since the square on BC is five times the square on CK, and AB is double of BC, and KL double of CK, therefore the square on AB is five times the square on KL. </p><p>But the square on the diameter of the sphere is also five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. [<a href="#elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</a>] </p><p>And AB is the diameter of the sphere; therefore KL is the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described; therefore KL is a side of the hexagon in the said circle. [<a href="#elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] </p><p>And, since the diameter of the sphere is made up of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the same circle, [<a href="#elem.13.16.p.1">XIII. 16, Por.</a>] and AB is the diameter of the sphere, while KL is a side of the hexagon, and AK is equal to LB, therefore each of the straight lines AK, LB is a side of the decagon inscribed in the circle from which the icosahedron has been described. </p><p>And, since LB belongs to a decagon, and ML to a hexagon, for ML is equal to KL, since it is also equal to HK, being the same distance from the centre, and each of the straight lines HK, KL is double of KC, therefore MB belongs to a pentagon. [<a href="#elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p><p>But the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosahedron; [<a href="#elem.13.16">XIII. 16</a>] therefore MB belongs to the icosahedron. </p><p>Now, since FB is a side of the cube, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at N, and let NB be the greater segment; therefore NB is a side of the dodecahedron.

[<a href="#elem.6.4">VI. 4</a>] </p><p>And, since the three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the square on the second; [<a href="#elem.5.def.9">V.

Q. E. D. </p><p>I say next that no other figure, besides the said five figures, can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular figures equal to one another.
      </p><p>For a solid angle cannot be constructed with two triangles, or indeed planes. </p><p>With three triangles the angle of the pyramid is constructed, with four the angle of the octahedron, and with five the angle of the icosahedron; but a solid angle cannot be formed by six equilateral and equiangular triangles placed together at one point, for, the angle of the equilateral triangle being two-thirds of a right angle, the six will be equal to four right angles: which is impossible, for any solid angle is contained by angles less than four right angles. [<a href="#elem.11.21">XI. 21</a>] </p><p>For the same reason, neither can a solid angle be constructed by more than six plane angles. </p><p>By three squares the angle of the cube is contained, but by four it is impossible for a solid angle to be contained, for they will again be four right angles. </p><p>By three equilateral and equiangular pentagons the angle of the dodecahedron is contained; but by four such it is impossible for any solid angle to be contained, for, the angle of the equilateral pentagon being a right angle and a fifth, the four angles will be greater than four right angles: which is impossible. </p><p>Neither again will a solid angle be contained by other polygonal figures by reason of the same absurdity. </p></div4><div4 type="QED"><p>Therefore etc. Q.
