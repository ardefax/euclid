# xslt

Experimenting with XSLT to do the document transforms. The transforms are performed in numeric order with minimal changes in each transformation to keep it simple.

Depends on [`saxon`](http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!using-xsl/commandline) and can be executed with the provided `Makefile`.

```sh
$ make
...
```
