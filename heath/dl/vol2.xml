      <p>Then, since <emph>DA</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>, and <emph>AC</emph> is common, therefore the two sides <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>; and the base <emph>DC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>DAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BAC</emph>.

      <p>Therefore the four straight lines <emph>EA</emph>, <emph>EB</emph>, <emph>EC</emph>, <emph>ED</emph> are equal to one another. </p>

      <p>Let the diameter <emph>AD</emph> of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph> be drawn; let the centre <emph>G</emph> of the circle be taken, and with centre <emph>D</emph> and distance <emph>DG</emph> let the circle <emph>EGCH</emph> be described; <figure /> let <emph>EG</emph>, <emph>CG</emph> be joined and carried through to the points <emph>B</emph>, <emph>F</emph>, and let <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>I say that the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral and equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the point <emph>G</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>GE</emph> is equal to <emph>GD</emph>.</hi>
       <pb n="108" /></p>
      <p>Again, since the point <emph>D</emph> is the centre of the circle <emph>GCH</emph>, <hi rend="center"><emph>DE</emph> is equal to <emph>DG</emph>.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But <emph>GE</emph> was proved equal to <emph>GD</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore <emph>GE</emph> is also equal to <emph>ED</emph>; therefore the triangle <emph>EGD</emph> is equilateral;</hi> and therefore its three angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>GDE</emph>, <emph>DEG</emph> are equal to one another, inasmuch as, in isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are equal to one another. [<ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>] </p>
      <p>And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two right angles; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>EGD</emph> is one-third of two right angles.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, the angle <emph>DGC</emph> can also be proved to be onethird of two right angles. </p>
      <p>And, since the straight line <emph>CG</emph> standing on <emph>EB</emph> makes the adjacent angles <emph>EGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> equal to two right angles, therefore the remaining angle <emph>CGB</emph> is also one-third of two right angles. </p>
      <p>Therefore the angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>DGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph> are equal to one another; so that the angles vertical to them, the angles <emph>BGA</emph>, <emph>AGF</emph>, <emph>FGE</emph> are equal. [<ref target="elem.1.15" targOrder="U">I. 15</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the six angles <emph>EGD</emph>, <emph>DGC</emph>, <emph>CGB</emph>, <emph>BGA</emph>, <emph>AGF</emph>, <emph>FGE</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [<ref target="elem.3.26" targOrder="U">III. 26</ref>] therefore the six circumferences <emph>AB</emph>, <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph>, <emph>DE</emph>, <emph>EF</emph>, <emph>FA</emph> are equal to one another. </p>
      <p>And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [<ref target="elem.3.29" targOrder="U">III. 29</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore the six straight lines are equal to one another; therefore the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equilateral.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>I say next that it is also equiangular. </p>
      <p>For, since the circumference <emph>FA</emph> is equal to the circumference <emph>ED</emph>, <hi rend="center">let the circumference <emph>ABCD</emph> be added to each; therefore the whole <emph>FABCD</emph> is equal to the whole <emph>EDCBA</emph>;</hi>
       <pb n="109" />and the angle <emph>FED</emph> stands on the circumference <emph>FABCD</emph>, and the angle <emph>AFE</emph> on the circumference <emph>EDCBA</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>AFE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>DEF</emph>. [<ref target="elem.3.27" targOrder="U">III. 27</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Similarly it can be proved that the remaining angles of the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> are also severally equal to each of the angles <emph>AFE</emph>, <emph>FED</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the hexagon <emph>ABCDEF</emph> is equiangular.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But it was also proved equilateral; and it has been inscribed in the circle <emph>ABCDEF</emph>. </p>

      <p>In the circle <emph>ABCD</emph> let there be inscribed a side <emph>AC</emph> of the equilateral triangle inscribed in it, and a side <emph>AB</emph> of an equilateral pentagon; therefore, of the equal segments of which there are fifteen in the circle <emph>ABCD</emph>, there will be five in the circumference <emph>ABC</emph> which is one-third of the circle, and there will be three in the circumference <emph>AB</emph> which is one-fifth of the circle; <hi rend="center">therefore in the remainder <emph>BC</emph> there will be two of the equal segments.</hi>

 In a number of expressions like this it is absolutely necessary, when translating into English, to interpolate words which are not in the Greek. Thus the Greek here is: <foreign lang="greek">Ἕστω τέσσαρα μεγέθη ἀνάλογον τὰ Α, Β, Γ, Δ, ὡς τὸ Α πρὸς τὸ Β, οὕτως τὸ Γ πρὸς τὸ Δ</foreign>, literally <quote>Let <emph>A</emph>, <emph>B</emph>, <emph>C</emph>, <emph>D</emph> be four proportional magnitudes, as <emph>A</emph> to <emph>B</emph>, so <emph>C</emph> to <emph>D</emph>.</quote>

      <p>Then, since <emph>CB</emph>, <emph>BG</emph>, <emph>GH</emph> are equal to one another, <hi rend="center">the triangles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>AGB</emph>, <emph>AHG</emph> are also equal to one <lb n="15" />another. [<ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>]</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever multiple the base <emph>HC</emph> is of the base <emph>BC</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ABC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason, <lb n="20" />whatever multiple the base <emph>LC</emph> is of the base <emph>CD</emph>, that multiple also is the triangle <emph>ALC</emph> of the triangle <emph>ACD</emph>; and, if the base <emph>HC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph> is also equal to the triangle <emph>ACL</emph>, [<ref target="elem.1.38" targOrder="U">I. 38</ref>] <pb n="192" />if the base <emph>HC</emph> is in excess of the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>
       <lb n="25" />is also in excess of the triangle <emph>ACL</emph>, and, if less, less. </p>
      <p>Thus, there being four magnitudes, two bases <emph>BC</emph>, <emph>CD</emph> and two triangles <emph>ABC</emph>, <emph>ACD</emph>, equimultiples have been taken of the base <emph>BC</emph> and the <lb n="30" />triangle <emph>ABC</emph>, namely the base <emph>HC</emph> and the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>, and of the base <emph>CD</emph> and the triangle <emph>ADC</emph> other, chance, equimultiples, namely the base <emph>LC</emph> and the triangle <emph>ALC</emph>; <hi rend="center">and it has been proved that,</hi> if the base <emph>HC</emph> is in excess of the base <emph>CL</emph>, the triangle <emph>AHC</emph>

      <p>Let <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> be similar polygons, and let <emph>AB</emph> correspond to <emph>FG</emph>; I say that the polygons <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> are divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in multitude and in <lb n="10" />the same ratio as the wholes, and the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> has to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which <emph>AB</emph> has to <emph>FG</emph>. </p>

      <p>Now, since the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> is similar to the polygon <lb n="15" /><emph>FGHKL</emph>, the angle <emph>BAE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFL</emph>; <hi rend="center">and, as <emph>BA</emph> is to <emph>AE</emph>, so is <emph>GF</emph> to <emph>FL</emph>.

      </p>
      <p>Since then <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>FGL</emph> are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles <lb n="20" />proportional, therefore the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] <hi rend="center">so that it is also similar; [<ref target="elem.6.4 elem.6.def.1" targOrder="U">VI. 4 and Def. 1</ref>]</hi> therefore the angle <emph>ABE</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FGL</emph>. <pb n="236" /><lb n="25" /></p>
      <p>But the whole angle <emph>ABC</emph> is also equal to the whole angle <emph>FGH</emph> because of the similarity of the polygons; therefore the remaining angle <emph>EBC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>LGH</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, since, because of the similarity of the triangles <emph>ABE</emph>, <lb n="30" /><emph>FGL</emph>, <hi rend="center">as <emph>EB</emph> is to <emph>BA</emph>, so is <emph>LG</emph> to <emph>GF</emph>,</hi> and moreover also, because of the similarity of the polygons, <hi rend="center">as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>FG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>,</hi> therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <emph>EB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>LG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>; [<ref target="elem.5.22" targOrder="U">V. 22</ref>] <lb n="35" />that is, the sides about the equal angles <emph>EBC</emph>, <emph>LGH</emph> are proportional; therefore the triangle <emph>EBC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>LGH</emph>, [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] <hi rend="center">so that the triangle <emph>EBC</emph> is also similar to the triangle <lb n="40" /><emph>LGH</emph>.

      </p>
      <p>For the same reason the triangle <emph>ECD</emph> is also similar to the triangle <emph>LHK</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore the similar polygons <emph>ABCDE</emph>, <emph>FGHKL</emph> have been divided into similar triangles, and into triangles equal in <lb n="45" />multitude. </p>
      <p>I say that they are also in the same ratio as the wholes, that is, in such manner that the triangles are proportional, and <emph>ABE</emph>, <emph>EBC</emph>, <emph>ECD</emph> are antecedents, while <emph>FGL</emph>, <emph>LGH</emph>, <emph>LHK</emph> are their consequents, and that the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph>

      <p>For let <emph>AC</emph>, <emph>FH</emph> be joined. </p>
      <p>Then since, because of the similarity of the polygons, <lb n="55" />the angle <emph>ABC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>FGH</emph>, and, as <emph>AB</emph> is to <emph>BC</emph>, so is <emph>FG</emph> to <emph>GH</emph>, <hi rend="center">the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <emph>FGH</emph>; [<ref target="elem.6.6" targOrder="U">VI. 6</ref>] therefore the angle <emph>BAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFH</emph>, and the angle <emph>BCA</emph> to the angle <emph>GHF</emph>.</hi>
       <lb n="60" /></p>
      <p>And, since the angle <emph>BAM</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>GFN</emph>, and the angle <emph>ABM</emph> is also equal to the angle <emph>FGN</emph>, <pb n="237" />therefore the remaining angle <emph>AMB</emph> is also equal to the remaining angle <emph>FNG</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.32" targOrder="U">I. 32</ref>] therefore the triangle <emph>ABM</emph> is equiangular with the triangle <lb n="65" /><emph>FGN</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that the triangle <emph>BMC</emph> is also equiangular with the triangle <emph>GNH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, proportionally, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MB</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NG</emph>, <lb n="70" />and, as <emph>BM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>GN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>; so that, in addition, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, <hi rend="center">as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>.</hi>

      <p>But, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABM</emph> to <emph>MBC</emph>, and <emph>AME</emph> to <emph>EMC</emph>; for they are to one another as their <lb n="75" />bases. [<ref target="elem.6.1" targOrder="U">VI. 1</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref>] therefore, as the triangle <emph>AMB</emph> is to <emph>BMC</emph>, so is <emph>ABE</emph> to <emph>CBE</emph>. <lb n="80" /></p>
      <p>But, as <emph>AMB</emph> is to <emph>BMC</emph>, so is <emph>AM</emph> to <emph>MC</emph>; therefore also, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> to the triangle <emph>EBC</emph>. </p>
      <p>For the same reason also, as <emph>FN</emph> is to <emph>NH</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> to the triangle <lb n="85" /><emph>GLH</emph>. </p>
      <p>And, as <emph>AM</emph> is to <emph>MC</emph>, so is <emph>FN</emph> to <emph>NH</emph>; therefore also, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>BEC</emph>, so is the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> to the triangle <emph>GLH</emph>; and, alternately, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, <lb n="90" />so is the triangle <emph>BEC</emph> to the triangle <emph>GLH</emph>. </p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove, if <emph>BD</emph>, <emph>GK</emph> be joined, that, as the triangle <emph>BEC</emph> is to the triangle <emph>LGH</emph>, so also is the triangle <emph>ECD</emph> to the triangle <emph>LHK</emph>. </p>
      <p>And since, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, <lb n="95" />so is <emph>EBC</emph> to <emph>LGH</emph>, and further <emph>ECD</emph> to <emph>LHK</emph>, therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [<ref target="elem.5.12" targOrder="U">V. 12</ref> therefore, as the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> is to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph>, so is the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> to the polygon <emph>FGHKL</emph>. <pb n="238" /><lb n="100" /></p>
      <p>But the triangle <emph>ABE</emph> has to the triangle <emph>FGL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <emph>AB</emph> has to the corresponding side <emph>FG</emph>; for similar triangles are in the duplicate ratio of the corresponding sides. [<ref target="elem.6.19" targOrder="U">VI. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the polygon <emph>ABCDE</emph> also has to the polygon <lb n="105" /><emph>FGHKL</emph> a ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side <emph>AB</emph> has to the corresponding side <emph>FG</emph>. </p>

      <p>For let two mean proportional numbers <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> fall between the two numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; I say that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are similar solid numbers. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>For let three numbers <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, the least of those which have the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, be taken; [<ref target="elem.7.33" targOrder="U">VII. 33</ref> or <ref target="elem.8.2" targOrder="U">VIII. 2</ref>] therefore the extremes of them <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are prime to one another. [<ref target="elem.8.3" targOrder="U">VIII. 3</ref>] </p>
      <p>Now, since one mean proportional number <hi rend="ital">F</hi> has fallen between <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are similar plane numbers. [<ref target="elem.8.20" targOrder="U">VIII. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>Let, then, <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi> be the sides of <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> of <hi rend="ital">G</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore it is manifest from the theorem before this that <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are continuously proportional in the ratio of <hi rend="ital">H</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi> and that of <hi rend="ital">K</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, and the multitude of the numbers <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is equal to the multitude of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">G</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>.

      <p>But <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are prime, primes are also least, [<ref target="elem.7.21" targOrder="U">VII. 21</ref>] and the least measure those which have the same ratio with <pb n="378" />them the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less, that is, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<ref target="elem.7.20" targOrder="U">VII. 20</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, as many times as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">N</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">N</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is the product of <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">N</hi> by multiplying the product of <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is solid, and <hi rend="ital">H</hi>, <hi rend="ital">K</hi>, <hi rend="ital">N</hi> are its sides. </p>
      <p>Again, since <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">F</hi>, <hi rend="ital">G</hi> are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio as <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now, as many times as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">O</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">G</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi> according to the units in <hi rend="ital">O</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">O</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">G</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">G</hi> is the product of <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">O</hi> by multiplying the product of <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is solid, and <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">O</hi> are its sides; therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> are solid. </p>

      <p>And, as <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">B</hi> to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">B</hi> also has to <hi rend="ital">C</hi> the ratio which a cube has to a cube. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">C</hi> is cube; therefore <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is also cube. [<ref target="elem.8.25" targOrder="U">VIII. 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>And since, as the unit is to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">A</hi> to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, and the unit measures <hi rend="ital">A</hi> according to the units in it, therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> also measures <hi rend="ital">B</hi> according to the units in itself; therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying itself has made the cube number <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, if a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it is also itself cube. [<ref target="elem.9.6" targOrder="U">IX. 6</ref>] </p>

      <p>Now, since <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> are least, they are prime to one another. [<ref target="elem.7.22" targOrder="U">VII. 22</ref>] </p>
      <p>But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [<ref target="elem.7.28" targOrder="U">VII. 28</ref>] therefore <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is also prime to each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>

      <p>But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [<ref target="elem.7.24" targOrder="U">VII. 24</ref>] so that the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is prime to <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; hence the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is also prime to the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.25" targOrder="U">VII. 25</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the product of <hi rend="ital">FD</hi>, <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> together with the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>; [<ref target="elem.2.3" targOrder="U">II. 3</ref>] therefore the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> together with the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is prime to the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>. </p>
      <p>And the square on <hi rend="ital">DE</hi> is <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, and the square on <hi rend="ital">EF</hi> is <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi> added together are prime to <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. <pb n="405" /></p>
      <p>Similarly we can prove that <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> added together are prime to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>I say next that <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi> added together are also prime to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>For, since <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is prime to each of the numbers <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>, the square on <hi rend="ital">DF</hi> is also prime to the product of <hi rend="ital">DE</hi>, <hi rend="ital">EF</hi>.

      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">A</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">M</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">M</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> according to the units in <hi rend="ital">A</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">A</hi> is a dyad; therefore <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is double of <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. <figure />
      </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> are continuously double of each other; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> are continuously proportional in double proportion. </p>
      <p>Now let there be subtracted from the second <hi rend="ital">HK</hi> and the last <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> the numbers <hi rend="ital">HN</hi>, <hi rend="ital">FO</hi>, each equal to the first <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore, as the excess of the second is to the first, so is the excess of the last to all those before it. [<ref target="elem.9.35" targOrder="U">IX. 35</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <hi rend="ital">NK</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">OG</hi> to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">KH</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">NK</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">OG</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">M</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">FO</hi> is also equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, and <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> and the unit. </p>
      <p>Therefore the whole <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> is equal to <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> and the unit; and it is measured by them. </p>
      <p>I say also that <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> will not be measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and the unit. </p>
      <p>For, if possible, let some number <hi rend="ital">P</hi> measure <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, and let <hi rend="ital">P</hi> not be the same with any of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, as many times as <hi rend="ital">P</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>, so many units let there be in <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> by multiplying <hi rend="ital">P</hi> has made <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>. <pb n="423" /></p>
      <p>But, further, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> has also by multiplying <hi rend="ital">D</hi> made <hi rend="ital">FG</hi>; therefore, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">P</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.19" targOrder="U">VII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, since <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are continuously proportional beginning from an unit, therefore <hi rend="ital">D</hi> will not be measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. [<ref target="elem.9.13" targOrder="U">IX. 13</ref>] </p>
      <p>And, by hypothesis, <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is not the same with any of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">P</hi> will not measure <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>But, as <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>; therefore neither does <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measure <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.def.20" targOrder="U">VII. Def. 20</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is prime; and any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure. [<ref target="elem.7.29" targOrder="U">VII. 29</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> are prime to one another. </p>
      <p>But primes are also least, [<ref target="elem.7.21" targOrder="U">VII. 21</ref>] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [<ref target="elem.7.20" targOrder="U">VII. 20</ref>] and, as <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">P</hi> to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">E</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">P</hi> the same number of times that <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> measures <hi rend="ital">D</hi>. </p>
      <p>But <hi rend="ital">D</hi> is not measured by any other number except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> is the same with one of the numbers <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>. </p>
      <p>Let it be the same with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>. </p>
      <p>And, however many <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi> are in multitude, let so many <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> be taken beginning from <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. </p>
      <p>Now <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> are in the same ratio with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>; therefore, <foreign lang="la">ex aequali</foreign>, as <hi rend="ital">B</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">E</hi> to <hi rend="ital">L</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.14" targOrder="U">VII. 14</ref>] </p>
      <p>Therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi> is equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.19" targOrder="U">VII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>But the product of <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi> is equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">P</hi>; therefore the product of <hi rend="ital">Q</hi>, <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is also equal to the product of <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> is to <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, so is <hi rend="ital">L</hi> to <hi rend="ital">P</hi>. [<ref target="elem.7.19" targOrder="U">VII. 19</ref>] </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">Q</hi> is the same with <hi rend="ital">B</hi>; therefore <hi rend="ital">L</hi> is also the same with <hi rend="ital">P</hi>; <pb n="424" />which is impossible, for by hypothesis <hi rend="ital">P</hi> is not the same with any of the numbers set out. </p>
      <p>Therefore no number will measure <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> except <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and the unit. </p>
      <p>And <hi rend="ital">FG</hi> was proved equal to <hi rend="ital">A</hi>, <hi rend="ital">B</hi>, <hi rend="ital">C</hi>, <hi rend="ital">D</hi>, <hi rend="ital">E</hi>, <hi rend="ital">HK</hi>, <hi rend="ital">L</hi>, <hi rend="ital">M</hi> and the unit; and a perfect number is that which is equal to its own parts; [<ref target="elem.7.def.22" targOrder="U">VII.
